Change: remove the ownCloud storage driver

We've removed the ownCloud storage driver because it was no longer
maintained after the ownCloud SQL storage driver was added.

If you have been using the ownCloud storage driver, please switch
to the ownCloud SQL storage driver which brings you more features and
is under active maintenance.
