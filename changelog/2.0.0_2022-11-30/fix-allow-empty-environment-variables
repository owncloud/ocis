Bugfix: Allow empty environment variables

We've fixed the behavior for empty environment variables, that previously would
not have overwritten default values. Therefore it had the same effect like not
setting the environment variable. We now check if the environment variable is
set at all and if so, we also allow to override a default value with an empty value.
