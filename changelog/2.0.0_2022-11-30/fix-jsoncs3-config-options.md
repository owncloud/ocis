Bugfix: Fix sharing jsoncs3 driver options

We've fixed the environment variable config options of the jsoncs3 driver that previously
used the same environment variables as the cs3 driver.
Now the jsoncs3 driver has it's own configuration environment variables.

If you used the jsoncs3 sharing driver and explicitly set `SHARING_PUBLIC_CS3_SYSTEM_USER_ID`,
this PR is a breaking change for your deployment. To workaround you may set the value you had
configured in `SHARING_PUBLIC_CS3_SYSTEM_USER_ID` to both `SHARING_PUBLIC_JSONCS3_SYSTEM_USER_ID`
and `SHARING_PUBLIC_JSONCS3_SYSTEM_USER_IDP`.
