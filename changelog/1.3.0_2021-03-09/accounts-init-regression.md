Bugfix: Purposely delay accounts service startup

As it turns out the race condition between `accounts <-> storage-metadata` still remains. This PR is a hotfix, and it should be followed up with a proper fix. Either:

- block the accounts' initialization until the storage metadata is ready (using the registry) or
- allow the accounts service to initialize and use a message broker to signal the accounts the metadata storage is ready to receive requests.
