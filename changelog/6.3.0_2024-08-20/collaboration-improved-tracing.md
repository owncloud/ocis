Enhancement: Tracing improvements in the collaboration service

Uploads and downloads through the collaboration service will be traced. The openInApp request will also be linked properly with other requests in the tracing.
In addition, the collaboration service will include some additional information in the traces. Filtering based on that information might be an option.
