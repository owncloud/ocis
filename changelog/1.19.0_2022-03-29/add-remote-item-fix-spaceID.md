Change: Add remote item to mountpoint and fix spaceID

A mountpoint represents the mounted share on the share receivers side. The original resource is located where the grant has been set. This item is now shown as libregraph remoteItem on the mountpoint. While adding this, we fixed the spaceID for mountpoints.
