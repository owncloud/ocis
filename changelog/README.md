# Changelog

We are using [calens](https://github.com/restic/calens) to properly generate a
changelog before we are tagging a new release. To get an idea how this could
look like <https://github.com/restic/restic/tree/master/changelog> would be the
best reference.

## Create changelog items

Create a file according to the template for each changelog in the unreleased folder. 
The following change types are possible: 
- Bugfix (general Bugfix)
- Enhancement (new feature)
- Change (breaking change) 
- Security (security related issues)
