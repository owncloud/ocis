Enhancement: Add web extensions deployment configuration

We added deployment configuration for the photo-addon and advanced-search web
extensions to the ocis_full example. This includes Docker compose files for
both extensions and CSP configuration for OpenStreetMap tiles required by the
photo-addon map feature.
