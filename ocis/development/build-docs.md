## Build the documentation

{{< hint info >}}
For building the documentation you need to have Make and Go 1.14 or higher installed.
{{< /hint >}}

Just run `make -C docs docs-serve` from within the root level of the oCIS git repository. This will make documentation available on [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) and also do a hot reload if you change something in the (non autogenerated) documentation files.

Note that you may get files changed reported like `env_vars.yaml` by just running the make command. You can discard any of these as they come from an internal helper process step necessary. To take care on those changed files, see the [Docs Helpers](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/tree/master/docs/helpers) readme.

## Add changes to the documentation

Please keep this documentation in sync with the oCIS source code.

Changes on the documentation are automatically applied to [this site]({{< ref "../" >}}) when merged to the master branch.
