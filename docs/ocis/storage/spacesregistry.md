## Storage Space Registries

A storage *spaces registry* manages the [*namespace*]({{< ref "./namespaces.md" >}}) for a *user*: it is used by *clients* to look up storage spaces a user has access to, the `/dav/spaces` endpoint to access it via WabDAV, and where the client should mount it in the users personal namespace.
