Environment variables are an essential part of configuring services.

If you are going to create new ones or deprecate existing ones, you must read the [Envvar Naming Scope]({{< ref "services/general-info/envvars/envvar-naming-scopes.md" >}}) and the 
[Deprecating Variables]({{< ref "services/general-info/envvars/deprecating-variables.md" >}}) documentation for more details first before doing so.
