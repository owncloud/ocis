#  Documentation

To contribute to documentation please see also: [Documentation](http://owncloud.dev/ocis/development/build-docs/)

Note that when running a helper like `make -C docs docs-generate` locally, you will see the generated output in e.g. docs/services/<service-name>. When merging a PR, the pipeline will generate the output in the master branch but finally moves it into the `docs` branch. You will therefore _not_ see changes in the docs folder of the master branch!
