Feature: checking file versions using file id
  As a user
  I want the versions of files to be available
  So that I can manage the changes made to the files

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And using spaces DAV path
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "Project1" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "Project1" with content "hello world version 1" to "text.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "Project1" with content "hello world version 1.1" to "text.txt"


  Scenario Outline: check the file versions of a file shared from project space
    Given user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | text.txt |
      | space           | Project1 |
      | sharee          | Brian    |
      | shareType       | user     |
      | permissionsRole | <role>   |
    And user "Brian" has a share "text.txt" synced
    When user "Alice" gets the number of versions of file "/text.txt" using file-id "<<FILEID>>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the number of versions should be "1"
    When user "Brian" tries to get the number of versions of file "/text.txt" using file-id "<<FILEID>>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    Examples:
      | role        |
      | File Editor |
      | Viewer      |


  Scenario Outline: check the versions of a file in a shared space as editor/manager
    Given user "Alice" has sent the following space share invitation:
      | space           | Project1     |
      | sharee          | Brian        |
      | shareType       | user         |
      | permissionsRole | <space-role> |
    When user "Alice" gets the number of versions of file "/text.txt" using file-id "<<FILEID>>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the number of versions should be "1"
    When user "Brian" gets the number of versions of file "/text.txt" using file-id "<<FILEID>>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the number of versions should be "1"
    Examples:
      | space-role   |
      | Space Editor |
      | Manager      |


  Scenario: check the versions of a file in a shared space as viewer
    Given user "Alice" has sent the following space share invitation:

      | shareType       | user         |
      | permissionsRole | Space Viewer |
    When user "Brian" tries to get the number of versions of file "/text.txt" using file-id "<<FILEID>>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
