Feature: accessing files using file id
  As a user
  I want to access the files using file id
  So that I can get the content of a file

  Background:
    Given using spaces DAV path
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario Outline: get content of a file
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" sends HTTP method "GET" to URL "<dav-path>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the downloaded content should be "some data"
    Examples:
      | dav-path               |
      | /dav/spaces/<<FILEID>> |


  Scenario Outline: get content of a file inside a folder
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "uploadFolder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "uploadFolder/textfile.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" sends HTTP method "GET" to URL "<dav-path>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the downloaded content should be "some data"
    Examples:
      | dav-path               |
      | /dav/spaces/<<FILEID>> |


  Scenario Outline: get content of a file inside a project space
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "new-space" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "new-space" with content "some data" to "textfile.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" sends HTTP method "GET" to URL "<dav-path>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the downloaded content should be "some data"
    Examples:
      | dav-path               |
      | /dav/spaces/<<FILEID>> |

      | permissionsRole | Viewer       |
    And user "Brian" has a share "textfile.txt" synced
    When user "Brian" sends HTTP method "GET" to URL "<dav-path>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the downloaded content should be "some data"
    Examples:
      | dav-path                          |
      | /dav/spaces/<<FILEID>>            |
