Feature: moving/renaming file using file id
  As a user
  I want to be able to move or rename files using file id
  So that I can manage my file system

  Background:
    Given using spaces DAV path
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes


  Scenario: move a file into a folder inside personal space
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "/folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" moves file with id "<<FILEID>>" as "/textfile.txt" into folder "/folder" inside space "Personal"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And for user "Alice" folder "folder" of the space "Personal" should contain these files:
      | textfile.txt |
    But for user "Alice" the space "Personal" should not contain these entries:
      | textfile.txt |


  Scenario: move a file into a sub-folder inside personal space
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "/folder"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "folder/sub-folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" moves file with id "<<FILEID>>" as "/textfile.txt" into folder "/folder/sub-folder" inside space "Personal"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And for user "Alice" folder "folder/sub-folder/" of the space "Personal" should contain these files:
      | textfile.txt |
    But for user "Alice" the space "Personal" should not contain these entries:
      | textfile.txt |


  Scenario: move a file from folder to root inside personal space
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "/folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "folder/textfile.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" moves file with id "<<FILEID>>" as "textfile.txt" into folder "/" inside space "Personal"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And for user "Alice" the space "Personal" should contain these entries:
      | textfile.txt |
    But for user "Alice" folder "folder" of the space "Personal" should not contain these files:
      | textfile.txt |


  Scenario: move a file from sub-folder to root inside personal space
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "/folder"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "folder/sub-folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "folder/sub-folder/textfile.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" moves file with id "<<FILEID>>" as "textfile.txt" into folder "/" inside space "Personal"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And for user "Alice" the space "Personal" should contain these entries:
      | textfile.txt |
    But for user "Alice" folder "folder/sub-folder" of the space "Personal" should not contain these files:
      | textfile.txt |

  Scenario: try to move a file into same folder with same name
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "textfile.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" moves file with id "<<FILEID>>" as "textfile.txt" into folder "/" inside space "Personal"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And as "Alice" file "textfile.txt" should not exist in the trashbin of the space "Personal"
    And for user "Alice" the content of the file "textfile.txt" of the space "Personal" should be "some data"


  Scenario Outline: move a file from personal to share space
    Given user "Brian" has been created with default attributes
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/folder"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:

      | sharee          | Brian         |
      | shareType       | user          |
      | permissionsRole | <permissions> |
    And user "Brian" has a share "folder" synced
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/test.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Brian" moves file with id "<<FILEID>>" as "test.txt" into folder "folder" inside space "Shares"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "502"
    And the value of the item "/d:error/s:message" in the response about user "Brian" should be "cross storage moves are not supported, use copy and delete"
    And for user "Brian" folder "/" of the space "Personal" should contain these files:
      | test.txt |
    But for user "Alice" folder "folder" of the space "Personal" should not contain these files:
      | test.txt |
    Examples:
      | permissions |
      | Editor      |
      | Viewer      |
