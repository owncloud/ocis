Feature: favorite
  As a user
  I want to favorite the shared resources
  So that I can access them quickly

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/PARENT"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/PARENT/parent.txt"


  Scenario Outline: favorite a file inside of a received share
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | PARENT   |
      | space           | Personal |
      | sharee          | Brian    |
      | shareType       | user     |
      | permissionsRole | Editor   |
    And user "Brian" has a share "PARENT" synced
    When user "Brian" favorites element "/Shares/PARENT/parent.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And as user "Brian" file "/Shares/PARENT/parent.txt" should be favorited
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |

      | shareType       | user     |
      | permissionsRole | Editor   |
    And user "Brian" has a share "PARENT" synced
    When user "Brian" favorites element "/Shares/PARENT/sub-folder" using the WebDAV API
