  Scenario Outline: favorite a folder
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" favorites element "/FOLDER" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And as user "Alice" folder "/FOLDER" should be favorited
    When user "Alice" gets the following properties of folder "/FOLDER" using the WebDAV API
      | propertyName |
      | oc:favorite  |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the single response should contain a property "oc:favorite" with value "1"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |
