  Scenario Outline: setting custom DAV property and reading it
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "testcustomprop.txt"
    When user "Alice" sets property "very-custom-prop" of file "testcustomprop.txt" to "veryCustomPropValue"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the xml response should contain a property "very-custom-prop"
    And the content in the response should include the following content:
      """
      <d:prop><very-custom-prop></very-custom-prop></d:prop>
      """
    When user "Alice" gets a custom property "very-custom-prop" of file "testcustomprop.txt"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the response should contain a custom "very-custom-prop" property with value "veryCustomPropValue"
    And the content in the response should include the following content:
      """
      <d:prop><very-custom-prop>veryCustomPropValue</very-custom-prop></d:prop>
      """
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |

  Scenario Outline: setting custom complex DAV property and reading it
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/testcustomprop.txt"
    When user "Alice" sets property "very-custom-prop" of file "testcustomprop.txt" to "<foo xmlns='http://bar'/>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the xml response should contain a property "very-custom-prop"
    When user "Alice" gets a custom property "very-custom-prop" of file "testcustomprop.txt"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the response should contain a custom "very-custom-prop" property with value "<foo xmlns='http://bar'/>"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |

  Scenario Outline: setting custom DAV property and reading it after the file is renamed
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/testcustompropwithmove.txt"
    And user "Alice" has set property "very-custom-prop" of file "testcustompropwithmove.txt" to "valueForMovetest"
    And user "Alice" has moved file "/testcustompropwithmove.txt" to "/catchmeifyoucan.txt"
    When user "Alice" gets a custom property "very-custom-prop" of file "catchmeifyoucan.txt"
    Then the response should contain a custom "very-custom-prop" property with value "valueForMovetest"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |

  Scenario Outline: setting custom DAV property on a shared file as an owner and reading as a recipient
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/testcustompropshared.txt"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:

      | permissionsRole | File Editor              |
    And user "Brian" has a share "testcustompropshared.txt" synced
    When user "Alice" sets property "very-custom-prop" of file "testcustompropshared.txt" to "valueForSharetest"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the xml response should contain a property "very-custom-prop"
    When user "Brian" gets a custom property "very-custom-prop" of file "Shares/testcustompropshared.txt"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the response should contain a custom "very-custom-prop" property with value "valueForSharetest"

    When user "Alice" sets property "very-custom-prop" with namespace "x1='http://whatever.org/ns'" of file "testcustomprop.txt" to "veryCustomPropValue" using the WebDAV API
