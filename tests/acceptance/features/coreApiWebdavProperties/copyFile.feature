Feature: copy file
  As a user
  I want to be able to copy files
  So that I can manage my files

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 0" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 1" to "/textfile1.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/FOLDER"

  Scenario Outline: copying a file
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" copies file "/textfile0.txt" to "/FOLDER/textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the content of file "/FOLDER/textfile0.txt" for user "Alice" should be "ownCloud test text file 0"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |

  Scenario Outline: copying and overwriting a file
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" copies file "/textfile0.txt" to "/textfile1.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And the content of file "/textfile1.txt" for user "Alice" should be "ownCloud test text file 0"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |

  Scenario Outline: copying a file when 2 files exist with different case
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    # "/textfile1.txt" already exists in the skeleton, make another with only case differences in the file name
    When user "Alice" copies file "/textfile0.txt" to "/TextFile1.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the content of file "/textfile1.txt" for user "Alice" should be "ownCloud test text file 1"
    And the content of file "/TextFile1.txt" for user "Alice" should be "ownCloud test text file 0"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |

      | permissionsRole | <permissions-role> |
    And user "Alice" has a share "testshare" synced
    When user "Alice" copies file "/textfile0.txt" to "/Shares/testshare/textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And user "Alice" should not be able to download file "/Shares/testshare/textfile0.txt"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version | permissions-role |
