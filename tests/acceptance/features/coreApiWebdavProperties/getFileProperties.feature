Feature: get file properties
  As a user
  I want to be able to get meta-information about files
  So that I can know file meta-information (detailed requirement TBD)

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes

  @smokeTest
  Scenario Outline: user sends a PROPFIND request on various file names
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content" to "<file-name>"
    When user "Alice" gets the properties of file "<file-name>" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the properties response should contain an etag
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version | file-name         |
      | old              | /upload.txt       |
      | old              | /strängé file.txt |
      | old              | /नेपाली.txt       |
      | old              | s,a,m,p,l,e.txt   |
      | new              | /upload.txt       |
      | new              | /strängé file.txt |
