  As a user
  I want to do search resources by tag
  So that I can find the files with the tag I am looking for

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  Scenario Outline: search files by tag
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created the following folders
      | path                      |
      | folderWithFile            |
      | folderWithFile/subFolder/ |
    And user "Alice" has uploaded the following files with content "some data"
      | path                                             |
      | fileInRootLevel.txt                              |
      | folderWithFile/fileInsideFolder.txt              |
      | folderWithFile/subFolder/fileInsideSubFolder.txt |
    And user "Alice" has tagged the following files of the space "Personal":
      | path                                             | tagName |
      | fileInRootLevel.txt                              | tag1    |
      | folderWithFile/fileInsideFolder.txt              | tag1    |
      | folderWithFile/subFolder/fileInsideSubFolder.txt | tag1    |
    When user "Alice" searches for "Tags:tag1" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the search result of user "Alice" should contain only these files:
      | fileInRootLevel.txt                              |
      | folderWithFile/fileInsideFolder.txt              |
