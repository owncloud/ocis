Feature: search sharees
  As a user
  I want to search sharees
  So that I can find them quickly

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | sharee1  |
    And group "ShareeGroup" has been created
    And group "ShareeGroup2" has been created
    And user "Alice" has been added to group "ShareeGroup2"

    When user "Alice" gets the sharees using the sharing API with parameters
      | search   | sharee |
      | itemType | file   |
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status-code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the "exact users" sharees returned should be empty
    And the "users" sharees returned should be
      | Sharee One | 0 | sharee1 | sharee1 |
