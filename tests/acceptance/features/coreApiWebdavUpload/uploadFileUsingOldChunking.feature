Feature: upload file using old chunking
  As a user
  I want to be able to upload "large" files in chunks
  So that the upload can be completed in less elapsed time

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes


  Scenario Outline: upload chunked file in ascending order
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" uploads the following "3" chunks to "/myChunkedFile.txt" with old chunking and using the WebDAV API
      | number | content |
      | 1      | AAAAA   |
      | 2      | BBBBB   |
      | 3      | CCCCC   |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions for user "Alice"
      | ETag | /^"[a-f0-9:\.]{1,32}"$/ |
    And as "Alice" file "/myChunkedFile.txt" should exist
    And the content of file "/myChunkedFile.txt" for user "Alice" should be "AAAAABBBBBCCCCC"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |


  Scenario Outline: upload chunked file in descending order
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" uploads the following "3" chunks to "/myChunkedFile.txt" with old chunking and using the WebDAV API
      | number | content |
      | 3      | CCCCC   |
      | 2      | BBBBB   |
      | 1      | AAAAA   |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And as "Alice" file "/myChunkedFile.txt" should exist
    And the content of file "/myChunkedFile.txt" for user "Alice" should be "AAAAABBBBBCCCCC"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |


  Scenario Outline: upload chunked file in random order
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" uploads the following "3" chunks to "/myChunkedFile.txt" with old chunking and using the WebDAV API
      | number | content |
      | 2      | BBBBB   |
      | 3      | CCCCC   |
      | 1      | AAAAA   |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And as "Alice" file "/myChunkedFile.txt" should exist
    And the content of file "/myChunkedFile.txt" for user "Alice" should be "AAAAABBBBBCCCCC"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |


  Scenario Outline: checking file id after a move overwrite using old chunking endpoint
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has copied file "/textfile0.txt" to "/existingFile.txt"
    And user "Alice" has stored id of file "/existingFile.txt"
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/existingFile.txt" in 3 chunks using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And user "Alice" file "/existingFile.txt" should have the previously stored id
    And the content of file "/existingFile.txt" for user "Alice" should be:

  # This smokeTest scenario does ordinary checks for chunked upload,
