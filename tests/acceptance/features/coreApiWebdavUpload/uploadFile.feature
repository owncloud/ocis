  Scenario Outline: upload a file and check etag and download content
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" uploads file with content "uploaded content" to "<file-name>" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions for user "Alice"
      | ETag | /^"[a-f0-9:\.]{1,32}"$/ |
    And the content of file "<file-name>" for user "Alice" should be "uploaded content"

      | old              | /upload.txt       |
      | old              | /नेपाली.txt       |

  Scenario Outline: upload a file and check download content
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path

  Scenario Outline: upload a file with the same mtime and different content multiple times (atleast 3 times)
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "file.txt" with mtime "Thu, 08 Aug 2019 04:18:13 GMT"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/davtest.txt" to "file.txt" with mtime "Thu, 08 Aug 2019 04:18:13 GMT"
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/lorem.txt" to "file.txt" with mtime "Thu, 08 Aug 2019 04:18:13 GMT" using the WebDAV API

    And the version folder of file "file.txt" for user "Alice" should contain "2" element
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |
