  Scenario Outline: upload a file and check etag and download content
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" uploads file with content "uploaded content" to "<file-name>" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions for user "Alice"
      | ETag | /^"[a-f0-9:\.]{1,32}"$/ |
    And the content of file "<file-name>" for user "Alice" should be "uploaded content"
    Examples:

      | old              | /upload.txt       |
      | old              | /नेपाली.txt       |
