Feature: Remove access to a drive
  https://owncloud.dev/libre-graph-api/#/drives.root/DeletePermissionSpaceRoot

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |
    And using spaces DAV path


  Scenario Outline: user removes user member from project space using root endpoint
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "NewSpace" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has sent the following space share invitation:
      | space           | NewSpace           |
      | sharee          | Brian              |
      | shareType       | user               |
      | permissionsRole | <permissions-role> |
    When user "Alice" removes the access of user "Brian" from space "NewSpace" using root endpoint of the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And the user "Brian" should not have a space called "NewSpace"
    Examples:
      | permissions-role |
      | Space Viewer     |
      | Space Editor     |
      | Manager          |
