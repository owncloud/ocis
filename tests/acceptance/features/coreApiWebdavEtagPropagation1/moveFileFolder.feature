Feature: propagation of etags when moving files or folders
  As a client app
  I want metadata (etags) of parent folder(s) to change when a file or folder is moved
  So that the client app can know to re-scan and sync the content of the folder(s)

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes


  Scenario Outline: renaming a file inside a folder changes its etag
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/upload"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content" to "/upload/file.txt"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/upload"
    When user "Alice" moves file "/upload/file.txt" to "/upload/renamed.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And these etags should have changed:
      | user  | path    |
      | Alice | /       |
      | Alice | /upload |
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |
