Feature: ListGrants role
  As a user
  I want to share resources with listGrants role
  So that sharee can view activities and grants list of shared resources

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And the administrator has enabled the following share permissions roles:
      | permissions-role            |
      | Viewer With ListGrants      |
      | File Editor With ListGrants |
      | Editor With ListGrants      |


  Scenario: user shares personal resources with ListGrants role
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "FolderToShare"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "to share" to "textfile1.txt"
    When user "Alice" sends the following resource share invitation using the Graph API:
      | resource        | textfile1.txt               |
      | space           | Personal                    |
      | sharee          | Brian                       |
      | shareType       | user                        |
      | permissionsRole | File Editor With ListGrants |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the JSON data of the response should match
