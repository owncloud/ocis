Feature: file versions remember the author of each version
  As a user
  I want to know the author of each version of a file
  So that I can better understand the version history and choose a version to restore

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "2"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes
    And user "Carol" has been created with default attributes


  Scenario: enable file versioning and check the history of changes from multiple users
    Given user "David" has been created with default attributes
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/test"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | test     |
      | space           | Personal |
      | sharee          | Brian    |
      | shareType       | user     |
      | permissionsRole | Editor   |
    And user "Brian" has a share "test" synced
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | test     |
      | space           | Personal |
      | sharee          | Carol    |
      | shareType       | user     |
      | permissionsRole | Editor   |
    And user "Carol" has a share "test" synced
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | test     |
      | space           | Personal |
      | sharee          | David    |
      | shareType       | user     |
      | permissionsRole | Editor   |
    And user "David" has a share "test" synced
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content alice" to "/test/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content brian" to "/Shares/test/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Carol" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content carol" to "/Shares/test/textfile0.txt"
    And user "David" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content david" to "/Shares/test/textfile0.txt"

    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the number of versions should be "3"
    And the content of version index "1" of file "/test/textfile0.txt" for user "Alice" should be "uploaded content carol"
    And the content of version index "2" of file "/test/textfile0.txt" for user "Alice" should be "uploaded content brian"

      | 1     | Carol  |
      | 2     | Brian  |
      | 3     | Alice  |


  Scenario: enable file versioning and check the history of changes from multiple users for shared folder in the group
