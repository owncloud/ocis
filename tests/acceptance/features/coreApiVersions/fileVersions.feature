Feature: dav-versions
  As a user
  I want the versions of files to be available
  So that I can manage the changes made to the files

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "2"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes


  Scenario Outline: upload file and no version is available
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/davtest.txt" to "/davtest.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the version folder of file "/davtest.txt" for user "Alice" should contain "0" elements
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |


  Scenario Outline: no version is available while uploading a file with multiple chunks
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/davtest.txt" to "lorem.txt" in 2 chunks using the WebDAV API
    Then the version folder of file "lorem.txt" for user "Alice" should contain "0" elements
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |

  @smokeTest
  Scenario Outline: upload a file twice and versions are available
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/davtest.txt" to "/davtest.txt" using the WebDAV API
    And user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/davtest.txt" to "/davtest.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on each endpoint should be "201, 204" respectively
    And the version folder of file "/davtest.txt" for user "Alice" should contain "1" element
    And the content length of file "/davtest.txt" with version index "1" for user "Alice" in versions folder should be "8"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |


  Scenario Outline: versions are available while uploading a file twice with multiple chunks

    And user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/davtest.txt" to "lorem.txt" in 3 chunks using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "201"
    And the version folder of file "lorem.txt" for user "Alice" should contain "1" element
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |

    And user "Alice" has deleted file "/davtest.txt"
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/davtest.txt" to "/davtest.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the version folder of file "/davtest.txt" for user "Alice" should contain "0" elements
    Examples:
