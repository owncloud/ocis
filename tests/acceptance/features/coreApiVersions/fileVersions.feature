Feature: dav-versions
  As a user
  I want the versions of files to be available
  So that I can manage the changes made to the files

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "2"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario Outline: upload file and no version is available
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/davtest.txt" to "/davtest.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the version folder of file "/davtest.txt" for user "Alice" should contain "0" elements
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |


  Scenario Outline: upload file and no version is available using various chunking methods (except new chunking)
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/davtest.txt" to filenames based on "/davtest.txt" with all mechanisms except new chunking using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code of all upload responses should be "201"
    And the version folder of file "/davtest.txt-olddav-regular" for user "Alice" should contain "0" elements
    And the version folder of file "/davtest.txt-newdav-regular" for user "Alice" should contain "0" elements
    And the version folder of file "/davtest.txt-olddav-oldchunking" for user "Alice" should contain "0" elements
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |

    And user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/davtest.txt" to "/davtest.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on each endpoint should be "201, 204" respectively
    And the version folder of file "/davtest.txt" for user "Alice" should contain "1" element
    And the content length of file "/davtest.txt" with version index "1" for user "Alice" in versions folder should be "8"

  Scenario: user can retrieve meta information of a file inside folder
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "testFolder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "123" to "/testFolder/davtest.txt"
    When user "Alice" retrieves the meta information of file "/testFolder/davtest.txt" using the meta API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the single response should contain a property "oc:meta-path-for-user" with value "/testFolder/davtest.txt"


  Scenario Outline: user cannot retrieve meta information of a file which is owned by somebody else
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "123" to "/davtest.txt "
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Brian" retrieves the meta information of fileId "<<FILEID>>" using the meta API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "404"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |


  Scenario Outline: user cannot retrieve meta information of a file that does not exist
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" retrieves the meta information of fileId "<file-id>" using the meta API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "400" or "404"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version | file-id                                                                                              | decoded-value                                                             | comment            |
