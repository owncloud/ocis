Feature: get groups and their members
  As an admin
  I want to be able to get groups
  So that I can see all the groups and their members

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API


  Scenario: admin user lists all the groups
    Given group "tea-lover" has been created
    And group "coffee-lover" has been created
    And group "h2o-lover" has been created
    When user "Alice" gets all the groups using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the extra groups returned by the API should be
      | tea-lover    |
      | coffee-lover |
      | h2o-lover    |
