Feature: add users to group
  As a admin
  I want to be able to add users to a group
  So that I can give a user access to the resources of the group

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes


  Scenario: adding a user to a group
    Given these groups have been created:
      | groupname   | comment                               |
      | simplegroup | nothing special here                  |
      | Espa√±a¬ß√†√¥≈ì‚Ç¨ | special European and other characters |
      | ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä      | Unicode group name                    |
    When the administrator adds the following users to the following groups using the Graph API
      | username | groupname   |
      | Alice    | simplegroup |
      | Alice    | Espa√±a¬ß√†√¥≈ì‚Ç¨ |
      | Alice    | ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä      |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "204"
    And the following users should be listed in the following groups
      | username | groupname   |
      | Alice    | simplegroup |
      | Alice    | Espa√±a¬ß√†√¥≈ì‚Ç¨ |
      | Alice    | ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä      |

  Scenario: add same user twice to a group at once
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Alice" has created a group "grp1" using the Graph API
    When the administrator "Alice" adds the following users to a group "grp1" at once using the Graph API
      | username |
      | Brian    |
      | Brian    |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And the user "Brian" should be listed once in the group "grp1"
