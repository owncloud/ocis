Feature: remove a user from a group
  As an admin
  I want to be able to remove a user from a group
  So that I can manage user access to group resources

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes


  Scenario: admin removes a user from a group
    Given these groups have been created:
      | groupname       | comment                               |
      | brand-new-group | nothing special here                  |
      | Espa√±a¬ß√†√¥≈ì‚Ç¨     | special European and other characters |
      | ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä          | Unicode group name                    |
    And the following users have been added to the following groups
      | username | groupname       |
      | Alice    | brand-new-group |
      | Alice    | Espa√±a¬ß√†√¥≈ì‚Ç¨     |
      | Alice    | ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä          |

  Scenario: admin tries to remove a user from a nonexistent group
    When the administrator tries to remove user "Alice" from a nonexistent group using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "404"


  Scenario Outline: non-admin user tries to remove a user from a nonexistent group
    Given user "Brian" has been created with default attributes
    And the administrator has assigned the role "<user-role>" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    When user "Alice" tries to remove user "Brian" from a nonexistent group using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    Examples:
      | user-role   |
      | Space Admin |
      | User        |
      | User Light  |
