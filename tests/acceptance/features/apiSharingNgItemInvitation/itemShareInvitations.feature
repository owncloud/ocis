  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |


  Scenario Outline: send share invitation to user with different roles
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "to share" to "/textfile1.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "FolderToShare"
    When user "Alice" sends the following resource share invitation using the Graph API:
