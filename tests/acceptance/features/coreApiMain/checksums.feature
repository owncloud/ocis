Feature: checksums
  As a user
  I want to upload files with checksum
  So that I can make sure that the files are uploaded with correct checksums

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes


  Scenario Outline: uploading a file with checksum should work
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/myChecksumFile.txt" with checksum "MD5:d70b40f177b14b470d1756a3c12b963a" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |
