Feature: unlock locked items
  As a user
  I want to unlock the resources previously locked by myself
  So that other users can make changes to the resources

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes


  Scenario Outline: unlock file locked by the user
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has locked file "textfile0.txt" setting the following properties
      | lockscope | exclusive |
    When user "Alice" unlocks the last created lock of file "textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And 0 locks should be reported for file "textfile0.txt" of user "Alice" by the WebDAV API
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |

  Scenario Outline: public tries to unlock a file in a share that was locked by the file owner
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And using SharingNG
    And user "Alice" has created folder "PARENT"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "PARENT/parent.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created the following resource link share:

      | password        | %public% |
    And user "Alice" has locked file "PARENT/parent.txt" setting the following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    When the public unlocks file "/parent.txt" with the last created lock of file "PARENT/parent.txt" of user "Alice" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And 1 locks should be reported for file "PARENT/parent.txt" of user "Alice" by the WebDAV API
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version | lock-scope |
      | old              | shared     |
