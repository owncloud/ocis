Feature: lock files
  As a user
  I want to lock files

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |


  Scenario Outline: lock a file
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "Alice Hansen" with content "some content" to "textfile.txt"
    When user "Alice" locks file "textfile.txt" using the WebDAV API setting the following properties
      | lockscope | exclusive |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    When user "Alice" sends PROPFIND request from the space "Alice Hansen" to the resource "textfile.txt" with depth "0" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And as user "Alice" the PROPFIND response should contain a resource "textfile.txt" with these key and value pairs:
      | key                                                  | value        |

    When user "Alice" sends PROPFIND request from the space "Alice Hansen" to the resource "textfile.txt" with depth "0" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And as user "Alice" the PROPFIND response should contain a resource "textfile.txt" with these key and value pairs:

  Scenario Outline: locking a file in a received share does not lock other items with the same name in other received shares (shares from same user)
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "locked/"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "notlocked/"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/locked/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/notlocked/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | locked   |
      | space           | Personal |

      | permissionsRole | Editor    |
    And user "Brian" has a share "notlocked" synced
    When user "Brian" locks file "/Shares/locked/textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API setting the following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And user "Brian" should be able to upload file "filesForUpload/lorem.txt" to "/Shares/notlocked/textfile0.txt"
