Feature: previews of files downloaded through the webdav API
  As a user
  I want to be able to download the preview of the files
  So that I can view the contents of the files

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes


  Scenario Outline: download previews with invalid width
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/lorem.txt" to "/parent.txt"
    When user "Alice" downloads the preview of "/parent.txt" with width "<width>" and height "32" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "400"
    And the value of the item "/d:error/s:message" in the response about user "Alice" should be "Cannot set width of 0 or smaller!"
    And the value of the item "/d:error/s:exception" in the response about user "Alice" should be "Sabre\DAV\Exception\BadRequest"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version | width |
      | old              | 0     |
      | old              | 0.5   |

    When user "Alice" downloads the preview of "/testimage.jpg" with width "36" and height "36" and processor thumbnail using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And the value of the item "/d:error/s:message" in the response should be "thumbnails: image is too large"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |

  Scenario Outline: try to download a file preview when the maximum thumbnail input value in the environment is set to a small value
    Given the following configs have been set:
      | config                               | value |
      | THUMBNAILS_MAX_INPUT_IMAGE_FILE_SIZE | 1KB   |
      | THUMBNAILS_MAX_INPUT_WIDTH           | 200   |
      | THUMBNAILS_MAX_INPUT_HEIGHT          | 200   |
    And using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/lorem-big.txt" to "/lorem-big.txt"
    When user "Alice" downloads the preview of "/lorem-big.txt" with width "36" and height "36" and processor thumbnail using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And the value of the item "/d:error/s:message" in the response should be "thumbnails: image is too large"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |
