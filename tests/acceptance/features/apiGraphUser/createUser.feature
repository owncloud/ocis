  Scenario Outline: admin creates a user
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    When the user "Alice" creates a new user with the following attributes using the Graph API:
      | userName       | <user>         |
      | displayName    | <display-name> |
      | email          | <email>        |
      | password       | <password>     |
      | accountEnabled | <enable>       |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "<http-status-code>"
    And user "<user>" <should-or-not> exist
    Examples:
      | user                         | display-name                            | email                   | password                     | http-status-code | enable | should-or-not |

  Scenario: user cannot be created with empty name
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    When the user "Alice" creates a new user with the following attributes using the Graph API:
      | userName       |              |
      | displayName    | emptyName    |
      | email          | @example.org |
      | password       | 123          |
      | accountEnabled | true         |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "400"


  Scenario Outline: user without admin right cannot create a user
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "<user-role>" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    When the user "Alice" creates a new user with the following attributes using the Graph API:
      | userName       | user         |
      | displayName    | user         |
      | email          | @example.org |
      | password       | 123          |
      | accountEnabled | true         |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And user "user" should not exist
    Examples:
      | user-role   |
      | Space Admin |
      | User        |
      | User Light  |


  Scenario: user cannot be created with the name of the disabled user
    Given user "Brian" has been created with default attributes
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And the user "Alice" has disabled user "Brian"
    When the user "Alice" creates a new user with the following attributes using the Graph API:
      | userName       | Brian                 |
      | displayName    | This is another Brian |
      | email          | brian@example.com     |
      | password       | 123                   |
      | accountEnabled | true                  |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "409"


  Scenario: user can be created with the name of the deleted user
    Given user "Brian" has been created with default attributes
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And the user "Alice" has deleted a user "Brian"
    When the user "Alice" creates a new user with the following attributes using the Graph API:
      | userName       | Brian                 |
      | displayName    | This is another Brian |
      | email          | brian@example.com     |
      | password       | 123                   |
      | accountEnabled | true                  |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And user "Brian" should exist

  @env-config
  Scenario Outline: create user with setting OCIS no restriction on the user name
    Given the config "GRAPH_USERNAME_MATCH" has been set to "none"
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    When the user "Alice" creates a new user with the following attributes using the Graph API:
      | userName       | <user>          |
      | displayName    | test user       |
      | email          | new@example.org |
      | password       | 123             |
      | accountEnabled | true            |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And user "<user>" should exist
    Examples:
      | user              | description                                 |
      | 1248Bob           | user names starts with the number           |
      | (*:!;+-&$%)_alice | user names starts with the ASCII characters |

  @env-config
  Scenario: create user with setting OCIS not to assign the default user role
    Given the config "GRAPH_ASSIGN_DEFAULT_USER_ROLE" has been set to "false"
    When the user "admin" creates a new user with the following attributes using the Graph API:
      | userName       | sam             |
      | displayName    | test user       |
      | email          | new@example.org |
      | password       | 123             |
      | accountEnabled | true            |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And user "sam" should exist
    When the administrator retrieves the assigned role of user "sam" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the Graph API response should have no role

  @env-config
  Scenario: create user with setting OCIS assign the default user role
    Given the config "GRAPH_ASSIGN_DEFAULT_USER_ROLE" has been set to "true"
    When the user "admin" creates a new user with the following attributes using the Graph API:
      | userName       | sam             |
      | displayName    | test user       |
      | email          | new@example.org |
      | password       | 123             |
      | accountEnabled | true            |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And user "sam" should exist
    And user "sam" should have the role "User" assigned


  Scenario: user is created with the default User role
    When the user "admin" creates a new user with the following attributes using the Graph API:
      | userName       | sam             |
      | displayName    | test user       |
      | email          | new@example.org |
      | password       | 123             |
      | accountEnabled | true            |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And user "sam" should exist
    And user "sam" should have the role "User" assigned
