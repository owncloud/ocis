  As a user
  I want to change my password
  So that I can use new combination as password


  Scenario Outline: change own password
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    When the user "Alice" changes its own password "<current-password>" to "<new-password>" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "<http-status-code>"
    Examples:
