  As a user
  I want to be notified of actions related to space
  So that I can stay updated about the spaces

      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |

    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "notification checking" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has sent the following space share invitation:
      | space           | notification checking |
      | sharee          | Brian                 |
      | shareType       | user                  |
