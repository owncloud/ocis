Feature: delete federated connections
  As a user
  I want to delete federated connections if they are no longer needed

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And using server "REMOTE"
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario: federated user deletes the federated connection
    Given using server "LOCAL"
    And "Alice" has created the federation share invitation
    And using server "REMOTE"
    And "Brian" has accepted invitation
    When user "Brian" deletes federated connection with user "Alice" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
