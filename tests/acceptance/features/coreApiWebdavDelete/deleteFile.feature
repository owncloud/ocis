  Scenario Outline: delete a file
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "to delete" to "/textfile0.txt"
    When user "Alice" deletes file "/textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And as "Alice" file "/textfile0.txt" should not exist
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |


  Scenario Outline: delete a file when 2 files exist with different case
