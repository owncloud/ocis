Feature: create file or folder named similar to Shares folder
  As a user
  I want to be able to create files and folders when the Shares folder exists
  So that I can organise the files in my file system

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | FOLDER   |
      | space           | Personal |
      | sharee          | Brian    |
      | shareType       | user     |
      | permissionsRole | Viewer   |
    And user "Brian" has a share "FOLDER" synced
