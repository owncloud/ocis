Feature: Share spaces
  As the owner of a space
  I want to be able to add members to a space, and to remove access for them
  So that I can manage the access to the space

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Bob      |
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "share space" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And using spaces DAV path


  Scenario Outline: space admin can share a space to another user
    When user "Alice" shares a space "share space" with settings:
      | shareWith | Brian        |
      | role      | <space-role> |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the OCS status code should be "200"
    And the OCS status message should be "OK"
    And the user "Brian" should have a space called "share space"
    Examples:
      | space-role |
      | manager    |
      | editor     |
      | viewer     |


  Scenario: user can see who has been granted access
    When user "Alice" shares a space "share space" with settings:
      | shareWith | Brian  |
      | role      | viewer |
    Then the user "Alice" should have a space called "share space" granted to user "Brian" with role "viewer"


  Scenario: user can see that the group has been granted access
    Given group "sales" has been created
    When user "Alice" shares a space "share space" with settings:
      | shareWith | sales  |
      | shareType | 8      |
      | role      | viewer |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the OCS status code should be "200"
    And the user "Alice" should have a space called "share space" granted to group "sales" with role "viewer"


  Scenario: user can see a file in a received shared space
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "share space" with content "Test" to "test.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created a folder "Folder Main" in space "share space"
    When user "Alice" shares a space "share space" with settings:
      | shareWith | Brian  |
      | role      | viewer |
    Then for user "Brian" the space "share space" should contain these entries:
      | test.txt    |
      | Folder Main |


  Scenario: user unshares a space
    Given user "Alice" has sent the following space share invitation:
      | space           | share space  |
      | sharee          | Brian        |
      | shareType       | user         |
      | permissionsRole | Space Viewer |
    When user "Alice" unshares a space "share space" to user "Brian"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    But the user "Brian" should not have a space called "share space"


  Scenario Outline: owner of a space cannot see the space after removing his access to the space
    Given user "Alice" has sent the following space share invitation:
      | space           | share space |

      | shareType       | user        |
      | permissionsRole | Manager     |
    When user "<user>" unshares a space "share space" to user "Alice"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    But the user "Alice" should not have a space called "share space"
    Examples:
      | user  |
      | Alice |
      | Brian |


  Scenario: user can add another user to the space managers to enable him
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "share space" with content "Test" to "test.txt"
    When user "Alice" shares a space "share space" with settings:

      | role      | manager |
    Then the user "Brian" should have a space called "share space" granted to "Brian" with role "manager"
    When user "Brian" shares a space "share space" with settings:

      | sharee             | Brian                    |
      | shareType          | user                     |

      | expirationDateTime | 2042-03-25T23:59:59.000Z |
    When user "Alice" expires the user share of space "share space" for user "Brian"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the user "Brian" should not have a space called "share space"
    Examples:
      | space-role   |
      | Manager      |
      | Space Editor |
      | Space Viewer |


  Scenario Outline: check the end of expiration of a space in group share
    Given group "sales" has been created
    And the administrator has added a user "Brian" to the group "sales" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has sent the following space share invitation:
      | space              | share space              |
      | sharee             | sales                    |
      | shareType          | group                    |
      | permissionsRole    | <space-role>             |
      | expirationDateTime | 2042-03-25T23:59:59.000Z |
    When user "Alice" expires the group share of space "share space" for group "sales"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the user "Brian" should not have a space called "share space"
    Examples:
      | space-role   |
      | Manager      |
      | Space Editor |
      | Space Viewer |


  Scenario Outline: user cannot share the personal space to an other user
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "<user-role>" to user "Brian" using the Graph API
    When user "Brian" shares a space "Brian Murphy" with settings:
      | shareWith | Bob    |
      | role      | viewer |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "400"
    And the OCS status message should be "can not add members to personal spaces"
    And the user "Bob" should not have a space called "Brian Murphy"
    Examples:
      | user-role   |
      | Space Admin |
      | Admin       |
      | User        |


  Scenario: user cannot share the personal space to a group
    Given group "sales" has been created
    And the administrator has added a user "Brian" to the group "sales" using the Graph API
    When user "Alice" shares a space "Alice Hansen" with settings:
      | shareWith | sales   |
      | shareType | 8       |
      | role      | manager |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "400"
    And the OCS status message should be "can not add members to personal spaces"
    And the user "Brian" should not have a space called "Alice Hansen"


  Scenario: last space manager cannot change his role
    Given user "Alice" has sent the following space share invitation:
      | space           | share space |
      | sharee          | Brian       |
      | shareType       | user        |
      | permissionsRole | Manager     |
    When user "Alice" updates the space "share space" with settings:
      | shareWith | Alice  |
      | role      | editor |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the OCS status code should be "200"
    When user "Brian" updates the space "share space" with settings:
      | shareWith | Brian  |
      | role      | editor |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And the OCS status code should be "403"
    And the user "Alice" should have a space called "share space" granted to "Brian" with role "manager"
    And the user "Alice" should have a space called "share space" granted to "Alice" with role "editor"
