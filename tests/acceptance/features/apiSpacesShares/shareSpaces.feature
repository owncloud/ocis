Feature: Share spaces
  As the owner of a space
  I want to be able to add members to a space, and to remove access for them
  So that I can manage the access to the space

  Note - this feature is run in CI with ACCOUNTS_HASH_DIFFICULTY set to the default for production
  See https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1542 and https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/839

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Bob      |
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "share space" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And using spaces DAV path


  Scenario Outline: space admin can share a space to another user
    When user "Alice" shares a space "share space" with settings:
      | shareWith | Brian  |
      | role      | <role> |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the OCS status code should be "200"
    And the OCS status message should be "OK"
    And the user "Brian" should have a space called "share space"
    Examples:
      | role    |
      | manager |
      | editor  |
      | viewer  |


  Scenario: user can see who has been granted access
    When user "Alice" shares a space "share space" with settings:
      | shareWith | Brian  |
      | role      | viewer |
    Then the user "Alice" should have a space called "share space" granted to user "Brian" with role "viewer"


  Scenario: user can see that the group has been granted access
    Given group "sales" has been created
    When user "Alice" shares a space "share space" with settings:
      | shareWith | sales  |
      | shareType | 8      |
      | role      | viewer |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the OCS status code should be "200"
    And the user "Alice" should have a space called "share space" granted to group "sales" with role "viewer"


  Scenario: user can see a file in a received shared space
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "share space" with content "Test" to "test.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created a folder "Folder Main" in space "share space"
    When user "Alice" shares a space "share space" with settings:
      | shareWith | Brian  |
      | role      | viewer |
