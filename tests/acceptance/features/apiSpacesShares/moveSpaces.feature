Feature: move (rename) file
  As a user
  I want to be able to move and rename files
  So that I can manage my file system

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And using spaces DAV path


  Scenario Outline: moving a file within same space project with role Manager and editor
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Brian" using the Graph API
    And user "Brian" has created a space "Project" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Brian" has created a folder "newfolder" in space "Project"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded a file inside space "Project" with content "some content" to "insideSpace.txt"
    And user "Brian" has sent the following space share invitation:
      | space           | Project      |
      | sharee          | Alice        |
      | shareType       | user         |
      | permissionsRole | <space-role> |
    When user "Alice" moves file "insideSpace.txt" to "newfolder/insideSpace.txt" in space "Project" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And for user "Alice" folder "newfolder" of the space "Project" should contain these entries:
      | insideSpace.txt |
    But for user "Alice" the space "Project" should not contain these entries:
      | insideSpace.txt |
    Examples:
      | space-role   |
      | Manager      |
      | Space Editor |


  Scenario: moving a file within same space project with role viewer
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Brian" using the Graph API
    And user "Brian" has created a space "Project" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Brian" has created a folder "newfolder" in space "Project"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded a file inside space "Project" with content "some content" to "insideSpace.txt"
    And user "Brian" has sent the following space share invitation:
      | space           | Project      |
      | sharee          | Alice        |
      | shareType       | user         |
      | permissionsRole | Space Viewer |
    When user "Alice" moves file "insideSpace.txt" to "newfolder/insideSpace.txt" in space "Project" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And for user "Alice" folder "newfolder" of the space "Project" should not contain these entries:
      | insideSpace.txt |
    But for user "Alice" the space "Project" should contain these entries:
      | insideSpace.txt |

      | permissions-role |
      | Editor           |
      | Uploader         |


  Scenario: sharee moves a file within a Shares space (viewer permissions)
    Given user "Brian" has created folder "testshare"
    And user "Brian" has created folder "testshare/child"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file with content "test file content" to "/testshare/testfile.txt"
    And user "Brian" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | testshare |
      | space           | Personal  |
      | sharee          | Alice     |
      | shareType       | user      |
      | permissionsRole | Viewer    |
    And user "Alice" has a share "testshare" synced
    When user "Alice" moves file "testshare/testfile.txt" from space "Shares" to "testshare/child/testfile.txt" inside space "Shares" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And for user "Alice" folder "testshare/child" of the space "Shares" should not contain these entries:
      | testfile.txt |
    But for user "Alice" folder "testshare" of the space "Shares" should contain these entries:
      | testfile.txt |

  Scenario Outline: sharee tries to move a file into same shared folder with same name
    Given user "Brian" has created folder "testshare"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file with content "test file content" to "testshare/testfile.txt"
    And user "Brian" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | testshare          |
      | space           | Personal           |
      | sharee          | Alice              |
      | shareType       | user               |
      | permissionsRole | <permissions-role> |
    And user "Alice" has a share "testshare" synced
    When user "Alice" moves file "testshare/testfile.txt" from space "Shares" to "testshare/testfile.txt" inside space "Shares" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And as "Brian" file "testfile.txt" should not exist in the trashbin of the space "Personal"
    And for user "Alice" the content of the file "testshare/testfile.txt" of the space "Shares" should be "test file content"
    And for user "Brian" the content of the file "testshare/testfile.txt" of the space "Personal" should be "test file content"
    Examples:
      | permissions-role |
      | Editor           |
      | Uploader         |
      | Viewer           |


  Scenario: overwrite a file while moving in project space
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Brian" using the Graph API
    And user "Brian" has created a space "Project" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Brian" has created a folder "folder" in space "Project"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded a file inside space "Project" with content "root file v1" to "testfile.txt"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded a file inside space "Project" with content "root file v2" to "testfile.txt"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded a file inside space "Project" with content "same name file" to "folder/testfile.txt"
    And user "Brian" has sent the following space share invitation:
      | space           | Project      |
      | sharee          | Alice        |
      | shareType       | user         |
      | permissionsRole | Space Editor |
    When user "Alice" overwrites file "testfile.txt" from space "Project" to "folder/testfile.txt" inside space "Project" while moving using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And for user "Alice" the content of the file "folder/testfile.txt" of the space "Project" should be "root file v2"
    And for user "Alice" the space "Project" should not contain these entries:
      | testfile.txt |
    When user "Brian" downloads version of the file "folder/testfile.txt" with the index "1" of the space "Project" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the downloaded content should be "root file v1"
