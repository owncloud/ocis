Feature: move (rename) file
  As a user
  I want to be able to move and rename files
  So that I can manage my file system

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And using spaces DAV path


  Scenario Outline: Moving a file within same space project with role manager and editor
    Given the administrator has given "Brian" the role "Space Admin" using the settings api
    And user "Brian" has created a space "Project" with the default quota using the GraphApi
    And user "Brian" has created a folder "newfolder" in space "Project"

    When user "Alice" moves file "insideSpace.txt" to "newfolder/insideSpace.txt" in space "Project" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And for user "Alice" the space "Project" should contain these entries:
      | newfolder/insideSpace.txt |
    And for user "Alice" the space "Project" should not contain these entries:
