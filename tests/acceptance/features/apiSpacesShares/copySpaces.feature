Feature: copy file
  As a user
  I want to be able to copy files
  So that I can manage my files

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And using spaces DAV path


  Scenario Outline: copying a file within a same project space with role manager and editor
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "Project" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a folder "/newfolder" in space "Project"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "Project" with content "some content" to "/insideSpace.txt"
