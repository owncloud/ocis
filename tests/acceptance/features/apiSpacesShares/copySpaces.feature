Feature: copy file
  As a user
  I want to be able to copy files
  So that I can manage my files

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And using spaces DAV path


  Scenario Outline: copying a file within a same project space with role manager and editor
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "Project" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a folder "/newfolder" in space "Project"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "Project" with content "some content" to "/insideSpace.txt"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following space share invitation:
      | space           | Project      |
      | sharee          | Brian        |
      | shareType       | user         |
      | permissionsRole | <space-role> |
    When user "Brian" copies file "/insideSpace.txt" to "/newfolder/insideSpace.txt" inside space "Project" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And for user "Brian" folder "newfolder" of the space "Project" should contain these files:
      | insideSpace.txt |
    And for user "Alice" the content of the file "/newfolder/insideSpace.txt" of the space "Project" should be "some content"
    Examples:
      | space-role   |
      | Manager      |
