Feature: checksums
  As a user
  I want to upload files with checksum
  So that I can make sure that the files are uploaded with correct checksums

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And using spaces DAV path
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  @issue-1291
  Scenario: sharing a file with checksum should return the checksum in the propfind using new DAV path
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/myChecksumFile.txt" with checksum "MD5:d70b40f177b14b470d1756a3c12b963a"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | myChecksumFile.txt |
      | space           | Personal           |
      | sharee          | Brian              |
      | shareType       | user               |
      | permissionsRole | Viewer             |
    And user "Brian" has a share "myChecksumFile.txt" synced
    When user "Brian" requests the checksum of file "/myChecksumFile.txt" in space "Shares" via propfind using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the webdav checksum should match "SHA1:3ee962b839762adb0ad8ba6023a4690be478de6f MD5:d70b40f177b14b470d1756a3c12b963a ADLER32:8ae90960"

  Scenario: modifying a shared file should return correct checksum in the propfind using new DAV path
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/myChecksumFile.txt" with checksum "MD5:d70b40f177b14b470d1756a3c12b963a"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | myChecksumFile.txt |
      | space           | Personal           |
      | sharee          | Brian              |
      | shareType       | user               |
      | permissionsRole | File Editor        |
    And user "Brian" has a share "myChecksumFile.txt" synced
    When user "Brian" uploads file with checksum "SHA1:ce5582148c6f0c1282335b87df5ed4be4b781399" and content "Some Text" to "/myChecksumFile.txt" in space "Shares" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And as user "Alice" the webdav checksum of "/myChecksumFile.txt" via propfind should match "SHA1:ce5582148c6f0c1282335b87df5ed4be4b781399 MD5:56e57920c3c8c727bfe7a5288cdf61c4 ADLER32:1048035a"
