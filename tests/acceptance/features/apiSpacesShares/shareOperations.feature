Feature: sharing
  As a user
  I want to share resources with different permissions
  So that I can manage the access to the resource

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And using spaces DAV path


  Scenario: correct webdav share-permissions for received file with edit permissions
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "foo" to "/tmp.txt"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:

    Examples:
      | ocs-api-version | permissions-role | permissions | http-status-code |
      | 1               | Edit             | change      | 200              |
      | 2               | Edit             | change      | 400              |
      | 1               | File Drop        | create      | 200              |
      | 2               | File Drop        | create      | 400              |


  Scenario Outline: space admin removes password of a public link share (read permission)
    Given using spaces DAV path
    And using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created folder "FOLDER"
    And using SharingNG
    And user "Alice" has created the following resource link share:
      | resource        | FOLDER   |
      | space           | Personal |
      | permissionsRole | View     |
      | password        | %public% |
    When user "Alice" updates the last public link share using the sharing API with
      | path        | /FOLDER |
      | permissions | read    |
      | password    |         |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status-code>"
    Examples:
      | ocs-api-version | ocs-status-code |
      | 1               | 100             |
      | 2               | 200             |
