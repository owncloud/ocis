Feature: Search
  As a user
  I want to search for resources in the space

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And using spaces DAV path
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "project101" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a folder "folderMain/SubFolder1/subFOLDER2" in space "project101"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "project101" with content "some content" to "folderMain/SubFolder1/subFOLDER2/insideTheFolder.txt"
