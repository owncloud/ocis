Feature: share resources where the sharee receives the share in multiple ways
  As a user
  I want to receives the same resource share from multiple channels
  So that I can make sure that the sharing works

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |


  Scenario Outline: creating and accepting a new share with user who already received a share through their group
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    And user "Brian" has disabled auto-accepting
    And group "grp1" has been created
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | textfile0.txt |
      | space           | Personal      |
      | sharee          | grp1          |
      | shareType       | group         |
      | permissionsRole | File Editor   |
    When user "Alice" shares file "/textfile0.txt" with user "Brian" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status-code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And user "Brian" should be able to accept pending share "/textfile0.txt" offered by user "Alice"
    And the fields of the last response to user "Alice" sharing with user "Brian" should include
      | share_with             | %username%            |
      | share_with_displayname | %displayname%         |
      | path                   | /textfile0.txt        |
      | file_target            | /Shares/textfile0.txt |
      | permissions            | read,update           |
      | uid_owner              | %username%            |
      | displayname_owner      | %displayname%         |
      | item_type              | file                  |
      | mimetype               | text/plain            |
      | storage_id             | ANY_VALUE             |
      | share_type             | user                  |
    Examples:
      | ocs-api-version | ocs-status-code |
      | 1               | 100             |
      | 2               | 200             |

  Scenario Outline: share receiver renames a group share and receives same resource through user share with additional permissions
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    And group "grp" has been created
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp"
    And user "Alice" has been added to group "grp"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "parent"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "parent/child"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "Share content" to "parent/child/lorem.txt"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | parent   |
      | space           | Personal |
      | sharee          | grp      |
      | shareType       | group    |
      | permissionsRole | Viewer   |
    And user "Brian" has moved folder "/Shares/parent" to "/Shares/sharedParent"
    When user "Alice" shares folder "parent" with user "Brian" with permissions "all" using the sharing API
    # Note: Brian has already accepted the share of this resource as a member of "grp".
    #       Now he has also received the same resource shared directly to "Brian".
    #       The server should effectively "auto-accept" this new "copy" of the resource
    #       and present to Brian only the single resource "Shares/sharedParent"
    Then as "Brian" folder "Shares/parent" should not exist
    And as "Brian" folder "Shares/sharedParent" should exist
    And as "Brian" file "Shares/sharedParent/child/lorem.txt" should exist
    Examples:
      | ocs-api-version |
      | 1               |
      | 2               |


  Scenario: share receiver renames a group share and receives same resource through user share with less permissions
    Given group "grp" has been created
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp"
    And user "Alice" has been added to group "grp"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "parent"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "parent/child"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "Share content" to "parent/child/lorem.txt"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | parent   |
      | space           | Personal |
      | sharee          | grp      |
      | shareType       | group    |
      | permissionsRole | Editor   |
    And user "Brian" should be able to rename folder "/Shares/parent" to "/Shares/sharedParent"
    And user "Alice" should be able to share folder "parent" with user "Brian" with permissions "read" using the sharing API
    # Note: Brian has already accepted the share of this resource as a member of "grp".
    #       Now he has also received the same resource shared directly to "Brian".
    #       The server should effectively "auto-accept" this new "copy" of the resource
    #       and present to Brian only the single resource "Shares/sharedParent"
    And as "Brian" folder "Shares/parent" should not exist
    And as "Brian" folder "Shares/sharedParent" should exist
    And as "Brian" file "Shares/sharedParent/child/lorem.txt" should exist
