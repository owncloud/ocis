Feature: PROPFIND with depth:infinity
  As a user
  I want to retrieve all properties of a resource
  So that I can get the information about a resource

  Background:
    Given the config "OCDAV_ALLOW_PROPFIND_DEPTH_INFINITY" has been set to "true"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And user "Alice" has created the following folders
      | path                                        |
      | simple-folder                               |
      | simple-folder/simple-folder1                |
      | simple-folder/simple-empty-folder           |
      | simple-folder/simple-folder1/simple-folder2 |
    And user "Alice" has uploaded the following files with content "simple-test-content"
      | path                                                      |
      | textfile0.txt                                             |
      | welcome.txt                                               |
      | simple-folder/textfile0.txt                               |

      | simple-folder/simple-folder1/simple-folder2/textfile0.txt |
      | simple-folder/simple-folder1/simple-folder2/welcome.txt   |


  Scenario Outline: get the list of resources with depth infinity
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" lists the resources in "/" with depth "infinity" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the last DAV response for user "Alice" should contain these nodes
