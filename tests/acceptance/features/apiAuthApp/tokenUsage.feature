Feature: create auth-app token
  As a user
  I want to create auth-app Tokens
  So that I can let 3rd party apps use my account

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And using auth-app token


  Scenario: admin creates user using auth-app token
    Given user "Admin" has created auth-app token with expiration time "1h" using the auth-app API
    When the user "Admin" creates a new user with the following attributes using the Graph API:
      | userName       | Brian                 |
      | displayName    | This is another Brian |
      | email          | brian@example.com     |
      | password       | brian123              |
      | accountEnabled | true                  |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the JSON response should contain space called "Alice Hansen" and match
      """
