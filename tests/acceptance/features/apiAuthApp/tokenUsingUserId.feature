Feature: create auth-app token using user-id
  As a user
  I want to create auth-app Tokens using user-id
  So that I can use 3rd party apps

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes

    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the JSON data of the response should match
