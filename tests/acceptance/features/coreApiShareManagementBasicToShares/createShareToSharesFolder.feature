Feature: sharing
  As a user
  I want to share resources to others
  So that they can have access on them

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  Scenario Outline: creating a share of a file with a user, the default permissions are read(1)+update(2)
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 0" to "/textfile0.txt"
    When user "Alice" shares file "textfile0.txt" with user "Brian" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status-code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the fields of the last response to user "Alice" sharing with user "Brian" should include
      | share_with             | %username%            |
