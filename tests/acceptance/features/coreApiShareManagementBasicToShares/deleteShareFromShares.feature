Feature: sharing
  As a user
  I want to delete shares
  So that I don't have redundant shares

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 0" to "/textfile0.txt"

  Scenario Outline: delete all group shares
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    And using SharingNG
    And group "grp1" has been created
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | textfile0.txt |
      | space           | Personal      |
      | sharee          | grp1          |
      | shareType       | group         |
      | permissionsRole | File Editor   |
    And user "Brian" has moved file "/Shares/textfile0.txt" to "/Shares/anotherName.txt"
    When user "Alice" deletes the last share using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status-code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And user "Brian" should not see the share id of the last share
    And as "Brian" file "/Shares/textfile0.txt" should not exist
    And as "Brian" file "/Shares/anotherName.txt" should not exist
    Examples:
      | ocs-api-version | ocs-status-code |
      | 1               | 100             |
