Feature:  enable or disable sync of incoming shares
  As a user
  I want to have control over the share received
  So that I can filter out the files and folder shared with Me

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And using spaces DAV path
