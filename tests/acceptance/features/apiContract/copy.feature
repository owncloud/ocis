Feature: Copy test
  As a user
  I want to check the PROPFIND response
  So that I can make sure that the response contains all the relevant values


  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
    And using spaces DAV path
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "new-space" with the default quota using the Graph API


  Scenario: check the COPY response headers
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "new-space" with content "some content" to "testfile.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created a folder "new" in space "new-space"
    When user "Alice" copies file "testfile.txt" from space "new-space" to "/new/testfile.txt" inside space "new-space" with following headers using the WebDAV API
      | header | value      |
      | Origin | %base_url% |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions
      | Oc-Fileid                   | /^[a-f0-9!\$\-]{110}$/ |
      | Access-Control-Allow-Origin | /^%base_url%$/         |
      | X-Request-Id                | %request_id_pattern%   |
