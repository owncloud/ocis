Feature: Update permission of a share
  As a user
  I want to update resources shared with me
  So that I can have more control over my shares and manage it
  https://owncloud.dev/libre-graph-api/#/drives.permissions/UpdatePermission

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |


  Scenario: user updates expiration date of a share
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "hello world" to "testfile.txt"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource           | testfile.txt         |
      | space              | Personal             |
      | sharee             | Brian                |
      | shareType          | user                 |
      | permissionsRole    | Viewer               |
      | expirationDateTime | 2025-07-15T14:00:00Z |
    When user "Alice" updates the last resource share with the following using the Graph API:
      | space              | Personal             |
      | resource           | testfile.txt         |
      | expirationDateTime | 2200-07-15T14:00:00Z |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the JSON data of the response should match
