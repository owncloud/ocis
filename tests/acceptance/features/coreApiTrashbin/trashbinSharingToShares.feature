Feature: using trashbin together with sharing
  As a user
  I want the deletion of the resources that I shared to end up in my trashbin
  So that I can restore the resources that were accidentally deleted

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "file to delete" to "/textfile0.txt"

  Scenario Outline: deleting a received folder doesn't move it to trashbin
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/shared"
    And user "Alice" has moved file "/textfile0.txt" to "/shared/shared_file.txt"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | shared   |
      | space           | Personal |
      | sharee          | Brian    |
      | shareType       | user     |
      | permissionsRole | Editor   |
    And user "Brian" has a share "shared" synced
    And user "Brian" has moved folder "/Shares/shared" to "/Shares/renamed_shared"
    When user "Brian" deletes folder "/Shares/renamed_shared" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And as "Brian" the folder with original path "/Shares/renamed_shared" should not exist in the trashbin
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |

  Scenario Outline: sharee deleting a file in a received folder after renaming the shared folder moves it to trashbin of both users
