  Scenario Outline: getting all shares from a user
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/file_to_share.txt"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | file_to_share.txt |
      | space           | Personal          |
      | sharee          | Brian             |
      | shareType       | user              |
      | permissionsRole | Viewer            |
    When user "Alice" gets all shares shared by her using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status-code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And file "/Shares/file_to_share.txt" should be included in the response
    Examples:
      | ocs-api-version | ocs-status-code |
      | 1               | 100             |
      | 2               | 200             |

  Scenario Outline: getting all shares of a user using another user
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | textfile0.txt |
      | space           | Personal      |
      | sharee          | Brian         |
      | shareType       | user          |
      | permissionsRole | Viewer        |
    When the administrator gets all shares shared by him using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status-code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And file "/Shares/textfile0.txt" should not be included in the response
    Examples:
      | ocs-api-version | ocs-status-code |
      | 1               | 100             |
      | 2               | 200             |
