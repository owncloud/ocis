Feature: accept/decline shares coming from internal users
  As a user
  I want to have control of which received shares I accept
  So that I can keep my file system clean

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And using new DAV path
    And these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |
    And group "grp1" has been created
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Carol" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "PARENT"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "PARENT/parent.txt"
    And user "Brian" has created folder "PARENT"
    And user "Brian" has created folder "FOLDER"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "textfile0.txt"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "PARENT/parent.txt"

  @smokeTest  @issue-2540
  Scenario: share a file & folder with another internal group when auto accept is disabled
    Given user "Brian" has disabled auto-accepting
    And user "Carol" has disabled auto-accepting
    And user "Carol" has created folder "FOLDER"
    And user "Carol" has created folder "PARENT"
    And user "Carol" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "textfile0.txt"
    When user "Alice" shares folder "/PARENT" with group "grp1" using the sharing API
    And user "Alice" shares file "/textfile0.txt" with group "grp1" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code of responses on all endpoints should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "200"
    And user "Brian" should see the following elements
      | /FOLDER        |
      | /PARENT        |
      | /textfile0.txt |
    But user "Brian" should not see the following elements
      | /Shares/PARENT            |
      | /Shares/PARENT/parent.txt |
      | /Shares/textfile0.txt     |
    And the sharing API should report to user "Brian" that these shares are in the pending state
      | path           |
      | /PARENT/       |
      | /textfile0.txt |
    And user "Carol" should see the following elements
      | /FOLDER        |
      | /PARENT        |
      | /textfile0.txt |
    But user "Carol" should not see the following elements
      | /Shares/PARENT            |
      | /Shares/PARENT/parent.txt |
      | /Shares/textfile0.txt     |
    And the sharing API should report to user "Carol" that these shares are in the pending state
      | path           |
      | /PARENT/       |
      | /textfile0.txt |
