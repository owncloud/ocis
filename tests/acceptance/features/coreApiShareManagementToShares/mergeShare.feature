Feature: sharing

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And group "grp1" has been created
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Brian" has disabled auto-accepting
