Feature: accept/decline shares coming from internal users to the Shares folder
  As a user
  I want to have control of which received shares I accept
  So that I can keep my file system clean

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And using new DAV path
    And these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |


  Scenario: accept an incoming file share
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 0" to "textfile0.txt"
    And user "Brian" has disabled auto-accepting
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | textfile0.txt |
      | space           | Personal      |
      | sharee          | Brian         |
      | shareType       | user          |
      | permissionsRole | Viewer        |
    When user "Brian" accepts share "/textfile0.txt" offered by user "Alice" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the content of file "/Shares/textfile0.txt" for user "Brian" should be "ownCloud test text file 0"


  Scenario: accept an incoming folder share
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "/PARENT"
    And user "Brian" has disabled auto-accepting
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file parent" to "PARENT/parent.txt"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | PARENT   |
      | space           | Personal |
      | sharee          | Brian    |
      | shareType       | user     |
      | permissionsRole | Viewer   |
    When user "Brian" accepts share "/PARENT" offered by user "Alice" using the sharing API
    Then the content of file "/Shares/PARENT/parent.txt" for user "Brian" should be "ownCloud test text file parent"


  Scenario: accept an incoming file share and check the response
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 0" to "textfile0.txt"
    And user "Brian" has disabled auto-accepting
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | textfile0.txt |
      | space           | Personal      |
      | sharee          | Brian         |
      | shareType       | user          |
      | permissionsRole | File Editor   |
    When user "Brian" accepts share "/textfile0.txt" offered by user "Alice" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the fields of the last response to user "Alice" sharing with user "Brian" should include
      | share_with             | %username%            |
      | share_with_displayname | %displayname%         |
      | file_target            | /Shares/textfile0.txt |
      | path                   | /Shares/textfile0.txt |
      | permissions            | read,update           |
      | uid_owner              | %username%            |
      | displayname_owner      | %displayname%         |
      | item_type              | file                  |
      | mimetype               | text/plain            |
      | storage_id             | ANY_VALUE             |
      | share_type             | user                  |
    And the content of file "/Shares/textfile0.txt" for user "Brian" should be "ownCloud test text file 0"


  Scenario: accept an incoming folder share and check the response

      | permissionsRole | Editor   |
    When user "Brian" accepts share "/PARENT" offered by user "Alice" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "100"

    And the fields of the last response to user "Alice" sharing with user "Brian" should include
      | share_with             | %username%           |

      | file_target            | /Shares/PARENT       |
      | path                   | /Shares/PARENT       |
      | permissions            | all                  |
