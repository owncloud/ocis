Feature: enforce password on public link
  As a user
  I want to enforce passwords on public links shared with upload, edit, or contribute permission
  So that the password is required to access the contents of the link

  Password requirements. set by default:
  | OCIS_SHARING_PUBLIC_SHARE_MUST_HAVE_PASSWORD  | true |
  | OCIS_PASSWORD_POLICY_MIN_CHARACTERS           | 8    |
  | OCIS_PASSWORD_POLICY_MIN_LOWERCASE_CHARACTERS | 1    |
  | OCIS_PASSWORD_POLICY_MIN_UPPERCASE_CHARACTERS | 1    |
  | OCIS_PASSWORD_POLICY_MIN_DIGITS               | 1    |
  | OCIS_PASSWORD_POLICY_MIN_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS   | 1    |


  Scenario Outline: create a public link with edit permission without a password when enforce-password is enabled
    Given the following configs have been set:
      | service  | config                                                 | value |
      | sharing  | SHARING_PUBLIC_SHARE_MUST_HAVE_PASSWORD                | false |
      | sharing  | SHARING_PUBLIC_WRITEABLE_SHARE_MUST_HAVE_PASSWORD      | true  |
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "test file" to "/testfile.txt"
    And using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    When user "Alice" creates a public link share using the sharing API with settings
      | path        | /testfile.txt |
      | permissions | 3             |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "<http-status-code>"
    And the OCS status code should be "400"
    And the OCS status message should be "missing required password"
    Examples:
      | ocs-api-version | http-status-code |
      | 1               | 200              |
      | 2               | 400              |


  Scenario Outline: create a public link with viewer permission without a password when enforce-password is enabled
    Given the following configs have been set:

      | sharing  | OCIS_SHARING_PUBLIC_WRITEABLE_SHARE_MUST_HAVE_PASSWORD | true  |
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "test file" to "/testfile.txt"
    And using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    When user "Alice" creates a public link share using the sharing API with settings
      | path        | /testfile.txt |
      | permissions | 1             |
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status-code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    Examples:
      | ocs-api-version | ocs-status-code |
      | 1               | 100             |
      | 2               | 200             |


  Scenario Outline: updates a public link to edit permission with a password
    Given the following configs have been set:

    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "test file" to "/testfile.txt"
    And using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    And using SharingNG
    And user "Alice" has created the following resource link share:

      | space           | Personal     |
      | permissionsRole | View         |
    When user "Alice" updates the last public link share using the sharing API with
      | permissions | 3        |
      | password    | %public% |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status-code>"
    And the OCS status message should be "OK"
    And the public should not be able to download file "/testfile.txt" from inside the last public link shared folder using the public WebDAV API without a password
    And the public should not be able to download file "/testfile.txt" from inside the last public link shared folder using the public WebDAV API with password "wrong pass"
    But the public should be able to download file "/testfile.txt" from inside the last public link shared folder using the public WebDAV API with password "%public%"
    Examples:
      | ocs-api-version | ocs-status-code |
      | 1               | 100             |
