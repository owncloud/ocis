Feature: update a public link share
  As a user
  I want to update a public link
  So that I change permissions whenever I want

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes


  Scenario Outline: change expiration date of a public link share and get its info
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "FOLDER"
    And using SharingNG
    And user "Alice" has created the following resource link share:
      | resource        | FOLDER   |
      | space           | Personal |
      | permissionsRole | View     |
      | password        | %public% |
    When user "Alice" updates the last public link share using the sharing API with
      | expireDate | 2040-01-01T23:59:59+0100 |
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status-code>"
    And the OCS status message should be "OK"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the fields of the last response to user "Alice" should include
      | id                         | A_STRING             |

  Scenario Outline: rename a file with public link and get its info
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    And using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some content" to "/lorem.txt"
    And using SharingNG
    And user "Alice" has created the following resource link share:
      | resource        | lorem.txt |
      | space           | Personal  |
      | permissionsRole | View      |
      | password        | %public%  |
    And user "Alice" has moved file "/lorem.txt" to "/new-lorem.txt"
    When user "Alice" gets the info of the last public link share using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status-code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the fields of the last response to user "Alice" should include
      | id                     | A_STRING       |

  Scenario Outline: update the role of a public link to internal
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    And using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/textfile.txt"
    And using SharingNG
    And user "Alice" has created the following resource link share:

      | permissionsRole | View         |
      | password        | %public%     |
    When user "Alice" updates the last public link share using the sharing API with
      | permissions | 0 |
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status-code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    Examples:
