Feature: upload to a public link share
  As a user
  I want to create a public link with upload permission
  So that the recipient can upload resources

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And user "Alice" has created folder "FOLDER"

  @issue-10331
  Scenario Outline: uploading file to a public upload-only share using public API that was deleted does not work
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And using SharingNG
    And user "Alice" has created the following resource link share:
      | resource        | FOLDER     |
      | space           | Personal   |
      | permissionsRole | File Drop  |
      | password        | %public%   |
    And user "Alice" has deleted folder "/FOLDER"
    When the public uploads file "test.txt" with password "%public%" and content "test-file" using the public WebDAV API
    And the HTTP status code should be "404"

    @issue-1268
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |

      | space           | Personal |
      | permissionsRole | View     |
      | password        | %public% |

    And the content of file "/FOLDER/test.txt" for user "Alice" should be "test-file"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions
      | ETag | /^"[a-f0-9:\.]{1,32}"$/ |
