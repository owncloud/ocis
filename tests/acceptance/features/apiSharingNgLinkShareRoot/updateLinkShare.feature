  https://owncloud.dev/libre-graph-api/#/drives.permissions/CreateLink

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |

  @env-config @issue-9724 @issue-10331
  Scenario: set password on a existing link share of a project-space drive using root endpoint
    Given the following configs have been set:
      | config                                       | value |
      | OCIS_SHARING_PUBLIC_SHARE_MUST_HAVE_PASSWORD | false |
    And using spaces DAV path
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "projectSpace" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "projectSpace" with content "to share" to "textfile.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created the following space link share:
      | space           | projectSpace |
      | permissionsRole | view         |
    When user "Alice" sets the following password for the last space link share using root endpoint of the Graph API:
      | space    | projectSpace |
      | password | %public%     |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the JSON data of the response should match
      """
      {
        "type": "object",
        "required": [

            "const": true
          }

      }
      """
    And the public should be able to download file "textfile.txt" from the last link share with password "%public%" and the content should be "to share"
