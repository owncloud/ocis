Feature: COPY file/folder
  As a user
  I want to copy a file or folder
  So that I can duplicate it

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/PARENT"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/PARENT/parent.txt"
    And using new DAV path

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: send COPY requests to webDav endpoints as normal user with wrong password
    When user "Alice" requests these endpoints with "COPY" using password "invalid" about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                           |
      | /remote.php/webdav/textfile0.txt                   |
      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/textfile0.txt     |
      | /remote.php/webdav/PARENT                          |
      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/PARENT            |
      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/PARENT/parent.txt |
      | /remote.php/dav/spaces/%spaceid%/textfile0.txt     |
      | /remote.php/dav/spaces/%spaceid%/PARENT            |
      | /remote.php/dav/spaces/%spaceid%/PARENT/parent.txt |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "401"

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: send COPY requests to webDav endpoints as normal user with no password
    When user "Alice" requests these endpoints with "COPY" using password "" about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                           |

      | /remote.php/dav/spaces/%spaceid%/PARENT            |
      | /remote.php/dav/spaces/%spaceid%/PARENT/parent.txt |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "401"
