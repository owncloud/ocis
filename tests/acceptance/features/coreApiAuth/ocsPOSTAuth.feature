Feature: auth
  As a user
  I want to send POST request to various endpoints
  So that I can make sure the endpoints need proper authentication

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes

  @issue-1337 @smokeTest
  Scenario: send POST requests to OCS endpoints as normal user with wrong password
    When user "Alice" requests these endpoints with "POST" including body "doesnotmatter" using password "invalid" about user "Alice"
