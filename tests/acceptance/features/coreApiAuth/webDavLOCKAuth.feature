Feature: LOCK file/folder
  As a user
  I want to lock a file or folder
  So that I can ensure that the resources won't be changed unexpectedly

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile1.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/PARENT"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/PARENT/parent.txt"

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: send LOCK requests to webDav endpoints as normal user with wrong password
    When user "Alice" requests these endpoints with "LOCK" including body "doesnotmatter" using password "invalid" about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                |
      | /webdav/textfile0.txt                   |
      | /dav/files/%username%/textfile0.txt     |
      | /webdav/PARENT                          |
      | /dav/files/%username%/PARENT            |
      | /dav/files/%username%/PARENT/parent.txt |
      | /dav/spaces/%spaceid%/textfile0.txt     |
      | /dav/spaces/%spaceid%/PARENT            |
      | /dav/spaces/%spaceid%/PARENT/parent.txt |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "401"

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: send LOCK requests to webDav endpoints as normal user with no password
    When user "Alice" requests these endpoints with "LOCK" including body "doesnotmatter" using password "" about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                |
      | /webdav/textfile0.txt                   |
      | /dav/files/%username%/textfile0.txt     |
      | /webdav/PARENT                          |

      | /dav/files/%username%/PARENT/parent.txt |
      | /dav/spaces/%spaceid%/textfile0.txt     |
      | /dav/spaces/%spaceid%/PARENT            |
      | /dav/spaces/%spaceid%/PARENT/parent.txt |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "401"

  Scenario: send LOCK requests to another user's webDav endpoints as normal user
    When user "Brian" requests these endpoints with "LOCK" to get property "d:shared" about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                            |
      | /dav/files/%username%/textfile0.txt |
      | /dav/files/%username%/PARENT        |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "403"
    When user "Brian" requests these endpoints with "LOCK" to get property "d:shared" about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                |
      | /dav/files/%username%/PARENT/parent.txt |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "409"
