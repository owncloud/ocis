  Scenario Outline: remove expiration date of a resource link share using permissions endpoint
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "other data" to "textfile1.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "folder"
    And user "Alice" has created the following resource link share:
      | resource           | <resource>               |
      | space              | Personal                 |
      | permissionsRole    | View                     |
      | password           | %public%                 |
      | expirationDateTime | 2200-07-15T14:00:00.000Z |
    When user "Alice" updates the last public link share using the permissions endpoint of the Graph API:
      | resource           | <resource> |
      | space              | Personal   |
      | expirationDateTime |            |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the JSON data of the response should match
