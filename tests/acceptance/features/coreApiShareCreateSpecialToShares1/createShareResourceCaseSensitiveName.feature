Feature: Sharing resources with different case names with the sharee and checking the coexistence of resources on sharee/receivers side
  As a user
  I want to share resources with case sensitive names
  So that I can make sure that the shares aren't case sensitive

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Brian" has disabled auto-accepting


  Scenario: sharing files with different case names with an internal user
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded the following files with content "some data"
      | path             |
      | textfile.txt     |
      | text_file.txt    |
      | 123textfile.txt  |
      | textfile.XYZ.txt |
      | TEXTFILE.txt     |
      | TEXT_FILE.txt    |
      | 123TEXTFILE.txt  |
      | TEXTFILE.xyz.txt |
    When user "Alice" shares the following files with user "Brian" using the sharing API
      | path             |
      | textfile.txt     |
      | text_file.txt    |
      | 123textfile.txt  |
      | textfile.XYZ.txt |
      | TEXTFILE.txt     |
      | TEXT_FILE.txt    |
      | 123TEXTFILE.txt  |
      | TEXTFILE.xyz.txt |
    And user "Brian" accepts the following shares offered by user "Alice" using the sharing API
      | path              |
      | /textfile.txt     |
      | /text_file.txt    |
      | /123textfile.txt  |
      | /textfile.XYZ.txt |
      | /TEXTFILE.txt     |
      | /TEXT_FILE.txt    |
      | /123TEXTFILE.txt  |
      | /TEXTFILE.xyz.txt |
    Then the OCS status code of responses on all endpoints should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "200"
    And as "Brian" the following files should exist
      | path                     |
      | /Shares/textfile.txt     |
      | /Shares/text_file.txt    |
      | /Shares/123textfile.txt  |
      | /Shares/textfile.XYZ.txt |
      | /Shares/TEXTFILE.txt     |
      | /Shares/TEXT_FILE.txt    |
      | /Shares/123TEXTFILE.txt  |
      | /Shares/TEXTFILE.xyz.txt |


  Scenario: sharing folders with different case names with an internal user
    Given user "Alice" has created the following folders
      | path    |
      | /FO     |
      | /F_O    |
      | /123FO  |
      | /FO.XYZ |
      | /fo     |
      | /f_o    |
      | /123fo  |
      | /fo.xyz |
    When user "Alice" shares the following folders with user "Brian" using the sharing API
      | path    |
      | /FO     |
      | /F_O    |
      | /123FO  |
      | /FO.XYZ |
      | /fo     |
      | /f_o    |
      | /123fo  |
      | /fo.xyz |
    And user "Brian" accepts the following shares offered by user "Alice" using the sharing API
      | path    |
      | /FO     |
      | /F_O    |
      | /123FO  |
      | /FO.XYZ |
      | /fo     |
      | /f_o    |
      | /123fo  |
