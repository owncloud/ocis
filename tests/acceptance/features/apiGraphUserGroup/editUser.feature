Feature: edit user
  As an admin
  I want to be able to edit user information
  So that I can manage users

  Note - this feature is run in CI with ACCOUNTS_HASH_DIFFICULTY set to the default for production
  See https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1542 and https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/839

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And the user "Alice" has created a new user with the following attributes:
      | userName    | Brian             |
      | displayName | Brian Murphy      |
      | email       | brian@example.com |
      | password    | 1234              |
