Feature: remove a user from a group
  As an admin
  I want to be able to remove a user from a group
  So that I can manage user access to group resources

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario: admin removes a user from a group
    Given these groups have been created:
      | groupname       | comment                               |
      | brand-new-group | nothing special here                  |
      | España§àôœ€     | special European and other characters |
      | नेपाली          | Unicode group name                    |
    And the following users have been added to the following groups
      | username | groupname       |
      | Alice    | brand-new-group |
      | Alice    | España§àôœ€     |
      | Alice    | नेपाली          |

    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "204"
    And the following users should not belong to the following groups
      | username | groupname       |
      | Alice    | brand-new-group |
      | Alice    | España§àôœ€     |
