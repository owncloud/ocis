Feature: create group
  As an admin
  I want to create a group
  So that I can add users to the group

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API


  Scenario Outline: admin user creates a group
    When user "Alice" creates a group "<group>" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And group "<group>" should exist
    Examples:
      | group           |
      | simplegroup     |
      | España§àôœ€     |
      | नेपाली          |
      | $x<=>[y*z^2+1]! |
      | 😅 😆           |
