Feature: delete groups
  As an admin
  I want to be able to delete groups
  So that I can remove unnecessary groups

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API


  Scenario Outline: admin user deletes a group
    Given group "<group>" has been created
    When user "Alice" deletes group "<group>" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And group "<group>" should not exist
    Examples:
      | group               | comment                               |
      | simplegroup         | nothing special here                  |
      | España§àôœ€         | special European and other characters |
      | नेपाली              | Unicode group name                    |
      | brand-new-group     | dash                                  |
      | the.group           | dot                                   |
      | left,right          | comma                                 |
      | 0                   | The "false" group                     |
      | Finance (NP)        | Space and brackets                    |

      | staff?group         | Question mark                         |
      | Mgmt/Sydney         | Slash (special escaping happens)      |
      | Mgmt//NSW/Sydney    | Multiple slash                        |

    And group "<group>" should not exist
    Examples:
      | group     | comment                                 |
      | 50%pass   | Percent sign (special escaping happens) |
      | 50%2Eagle | %2E literal looks like an escaped "."   |
      | 50%2Fix   | %2F literal looks like an escaped slash |

    And group "grp2" has been created
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "sample text" to "lorem.txt"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | lorem.txt |
      | space           | Personal  |
      | sharee          | grp1      |

    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | lorem.txt |
      | space           | Personal  |
      | sharee          | grp2      |
      | shareType       | group     |
      | permissionsRole | Viewer    |
    And group "grp1" has been deleted
    When user "Alice" gets all the shares of the file "lorem.txt" using the sharing API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And group "grp2" should be included in the response
    But group "grp1" should not be included in the response

      | resource        | lorem.txt |
      | space           | Personal  |
      | sharee          | grp1      |
      | shareType       | group     |
