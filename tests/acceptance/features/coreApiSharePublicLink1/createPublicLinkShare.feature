Feature: create a public link share
  As a user
  I want to create public links
  So that I can share resources to people who aren't owncloud users

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes

  @smokeTest @skipOnReva
  Scenario Outline: creating public link share of a file or a folder using the default permissions without password using the public WebDAV API
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "Random data" to "/randomfile.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/PARENT"
    When user "Alice" creates a public link share using the sharing API with settings
      | path | randomfile.txt |
    Then the OCS status code should be "400"
    And the HTTP status code should be "<http-status-code>"
    When user "Alice" creates a public link share using the sharing API with settings
      | path | PARENT |
    Then the OCS status code should be "400"
    And the HTTP status code should be "<http-status-code>"
    Examples:
      | ocs-api-version | http-status-code |
      | 1               | 200              |
      | 2               | 400              |

  Scenario Outline: creating a new public link share of a file with password using the public WebDAV API
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "Random data" to "/randomfile.txt"
    When user "Alice" creates a public link share using the sharing API with settings
      | path     | randomfile.txt |
      | password | %public%       |
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status-code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the fields of the last response to user "Alice" should include
      | item_type              | file            |
      | mimetype               | text/plain      |
      | file_target            | /randomfile.txt |
      | path                   | /randomfile.txt |
      | permissions            | read            |
      | share_type             | public_link     |
      | displayname_file_owner | %displayname%   |
      | displayname_owner      | %displayname%   |
      | uid_file_owner         | %username%      |
      | uid_owner              | %username%      |
      | name                   |                 |
    And the public should be able to download the last publicly shared file using the public WebDAV API with password "%public%" and the content should be "Random data"
    When the public tries to download the last public link shared file with password "%regular%" using the public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "401"
    And the value of the item "//s:message" in the response should match "/Username or password was incorrect/"
    When the public tries to download the last public link shared file using the public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "401"
    And the value of the item "//s:message" in the response should match "/No 'Authorization: Basic' header found/"
    Examples:
      | ocs-api-version | ocs-status-code |
      | 1               | 100             |
      | 2               | 200             |

      | permissions | read,update,create,delete |
      | password    | %public%                  |
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status-code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"

      | name                   |                 |
    And the public should be able to download the last publicly shared file using the public WebDAV API with password "%public%" and the content should be "Random data"
    And uploading content to a public link shared file with password "%public%" should work using the public WebDAV API
    Examples:
      | ocs-api-version | ocs-status-code |
      | 1               | 100             |

    And user "Alice" has created folder "testFolder"
    And using SharingNG
    And user "Alice" has created the following resource link share:
      | resource        | testFolder |
      | space           | Personal   |
      | permissionsRole | Edit       |
    When the public uploads file "file.txt" to the last public link shared folder with password "%public%" with mtime "Thu, 08 Aug 2019 04:18:13 GMT" using the public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And as "Alice" file "testFolder/file.txt" should exist
    And as "Alice" the mtime of the file "testFolder/file.txt" should be "Thu, 08 Aug 2019 04:18:13 GMT"
    And the mtime of file "file.txt" in the last shared public link using the WebDAV API should be "Thu, 08 Aug 2019 04:18:13 GMT"

  Scenario: overwriting a file changes its mtime (public webDAV API)
    Given the config "OCIS_SHARING_PUBLIC_SHARE_MUST_HAVE_PASSWORD" has been set to "false"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "testFolder"
    When user "Alice" uploads file with content "uploaded content for file name ending with a dot" to "testFolder/file.txt" using the WebDAV API

    And the public uploads file "file.txt" to the last public link shared folder with password "%public%" with mtime "Thu, 08 Aug 2019 04:18:13 GMT" using the public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And as "Alice" file "/testFolder/file.txt" should exist
    And as "Alice" the mtime of the file "testFolder/file.txt" should be "Thu, 08 Aug 2019 04:18:13 GMT"

  Scenario Outline: create a password-protected public link on a file with the name same to the previously deleted one
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "test data 1" to "/test.txt"
    And using SharingNG
    And user "Alice" has created the following resource link share:
      | resource        | test.txt |
      | space           | Personal |
      | permissionsRole | View     |
      | password        | %public% |
    And user "Alice" has deleted file "test.txt"
    When user "Alice" updates the last public link share using the sharing API with
      | password | Test:123345 |
    Then the OCS status code should be "998"
    And the HTTP status code should be "<http-status-code>"
    And the OCS status message should be "update public share: resource not found"
    Examples:
