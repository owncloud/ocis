Feature: changing a public link share
  As a user
  I want to set the permissions of a public link share
  So that people who have the public link only have the designated authorization

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
    And user "Alice" has created folder "PARENT"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "PARENT/parent.txt"

  @issue-10331
  Scenario Outline: public can or cannot delete file through publicly shared link depending on having delete permissions using the public WebDAV API
    Given using SharingNG
    And user "Alice" has created the following resource link share:
      | resource        | PARENT             |
      | space           | Personal           |
      | permissionsRole | <permissions-role> |
      | password        | %public%           |
    When the public deletes file "parent.txt" from the last link share with password "%public%" using the public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "<http-status-code>"
    And as "Alice" file "PARENT/parent.txt" <should-or-not> exist
    Examples:
      | permissions-role | http-status-code | should-or-not |
      | View             | 403              | should        |
      | Upload           | 403              | should        |
      | File Drop        | 403              | should        |
      | Edit             | 204              | should not    |

  Scenario: public link share permissions work correctly for renaming and share permissions edit using the public WebDAV API
    Given using SharingNG
    And user "Alice" has created the following resource link share:
      | resource        | PARENT   |
      | space           | Personal |
      | permissionsRole | Edit     |
      | password        | %public% |
    When the public renames file "parent.txt" to "newparent.txt" from the last public link share using the password "%public%" and the public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And as "Alice" file "/PARENT/parent.txt" should not exist

      | password        | %public% |
    When the public uploads file "lorem.txt" with password "%public%" and content "test" using the public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
