Feature: sharing
  As a user
  I want to check the webdav share permissions
  So that I know the resources have proper permissions

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |

  @smokeTest
  Scenario Outline: check webdav share-permissions for owned file
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "foo" to "/tmp.txt"
    When user "Alice" gets the following properties of file "/tmp.txt" using the WebDAV API
      | propertyName          |
      | ocs:share-permissions |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the single response should contain a property "ocs:share-permissions" with value "19"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |
