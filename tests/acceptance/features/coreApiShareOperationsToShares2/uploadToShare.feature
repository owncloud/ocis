Feature: sharing
  As a user
  I want to upload resources to a folder shared to me
  So that other people can access the resource

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes


  Scenario Outline: uploading file to a user read-only share folder does not work
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes
    And user "Alice" has created folder "FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | FOLDER   |

      | sharee          | Brian    |
      | shareType       | user     |
      | permissionsRole | Viewer   |
    When user "Brian" uploads file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/Shares/FOLDER/textfile.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And as "Alice" file "/FOLDER/textfile.txt" should not exist

    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1"
