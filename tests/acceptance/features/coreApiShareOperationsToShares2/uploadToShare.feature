Feature: sharing
  As a user
  I want to upload resources to a folder shared to me
  So that other people can access the resource

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario: uploading file to a user read-only share folder does not work
    Given user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has created folder "FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | FOLDER   |
      | space           | Personal |
      | sharee          | Brian    |
      | shareType       | user     |
      | permissionsRole | Viewer   |
    When user "Brian" uploads file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/Shares/FOLDER/textfile.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And as "Alice" file "/FOLDER/textfile.txt" should not exist


  Scenario Outline: uploading file to a group read-only share folder does not work
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And group "grp1" has been created
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1"

    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions for user "Brian"
      | ETag | /^"[a-f0-9:\.]{1,32}"$/ |
    And the content of file "/FOLDER/textfile.txt" for user "Alice" should be:
