Feature: move (rename) file
  As a user
  I want to be able to move and rename files
  So that I can manage my file system

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  Scenario Outline: moving a file
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 0" to "textfile0.txt"
    When user "Alice" moves file "/textfile0.txt" to "/FOLDER/textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions for user "Alice"
      | ETag | /^"[a-f0-9:\.]{1,32}"$/ |
    And the content of file "/FOLDER/textfile0.txt" for user "Alice" should be "ownCloud test text file 0"

  Scenario Outline: moving a file from a folder to the root
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "<source-folder>"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 0" to "/<source-folder>/<source-file>"
    When user "Alice" moves file "/<source-folder>/<source-file>" to "/<destination-file>" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions for user "Alice"
      | ETag | /^"[a-f0-9:\.]{1,32}"$/ |
    And the content of file "/<destination-file>" for user "Alice" should be "ownCloud test text file 0"
