Feature: move (rename) file
  As a user
  I want to be able to move and rename files
  So that I can manage my file system

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario Outline: sharer moves a file into a shared folder
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Brian" has created folder "/testshare"
    And user "Brian" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | testshare          |
      | space           | Personal           |
      | sharee          | Alice              |
      | shareType       | user               |
      | permissionsRole | <permissions-role> |
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file with content "test data" to "/testfile.txt"
    When user "Brian" moves file "/testfile.txt" to "testshare/testfile.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the content of file "/Shares/testshare/testfile.txt" for user "Alice" should be "test data"
    And the content of file "/testshare/testfile.txt" for user "Brian" should be "test data"
    And as "Brian" file "/testfile.txt" should not exist
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version | permissions-role |
      | old              | Viewer           |
      | old              | Uploader         |

      | shareType       | user               |
      | permissionsRole | <permissions-role> |
    And user "Alice" has a share "testshare" synced
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "test data" to "/testfile.txt"
    When user "Alice" moves file "/testfile.txt" to "Shares/testshare/testfile.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "502"
    And as "Alice" file "Shares/testshare/testfile.txt" should not exist
    And as "Brian" file "testshare/testfile.txt" should not exist
    But as "Alice" file "/testfile.txt" should exist
    Examples:
