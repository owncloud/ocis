Feature: restore deleted files/folders
  As a user
  I would like to restore files/folders
  So that I can recover accidentally deleted files/folders in ownCloud

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "file to delete" to "/textfile0.txt"

  @smokeTest
  Scenario Outline: deleted file can be restored
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/PARENT"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "parent text" to "/PARENT/parent.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "text file 1" to "/textfile1.txt"
    And user "Alice" has deleted file "/textfile0.txt"
    And as "Alice" file "/textfile0.txt" should exist in the trashbin
    When user "Alice" restores the file with original path "/textfile0.txt" using the trashbin API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions for user "Alice"
      | ETag | /^"[a-f0-9:\.]{1,32}"$/ |
    And as "Alice" the file with original path "/textfile0.txt" should not exist in the trashbin
    And the content of file "/textfile0.txt" for user "Alice" should be "file to delete"
    And user "Alice" should see the following elements
      | /FOLDER            |

    And user "Alice" has deleted file "/new-folder/new-file.txt"
    And user "Alice" has deleted folder "/new-folder"
    When user "Alice" restores the folder with original path "/new-folder" using the trashbin API
