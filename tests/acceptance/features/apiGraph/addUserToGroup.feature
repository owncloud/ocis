Feature: add users to group
  As a admin
  I want to be able to add users to a group
  So that I can give a user access to the resources of the group

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario: adding a user to a group
    Given these groups have been created:
      | groupname   | comment                               |
      | simplegroup | nothing special here                  |
      | España§àôœ€ | special European and other characters |
      | नेपाली        | Unicode group name                    |
    When the administrator adds the following users to the following groups using the Graph API
      | username | groupname   |
      | Alice    | simplegroup |
      | Alice    | España§àôœ€ |
      | Alice    | नेपाली        |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "204"
    And the following users should be listed in the following groups
      | username | groupname   |
      | Alice    | simplegroup |
