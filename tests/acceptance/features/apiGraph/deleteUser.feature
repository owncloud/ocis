Feature: delete user
  As an admin
  I want to be able to delete users
  So that I can remove unnecessary users

  Note - this feature is run in CI with ACCOUNTS_HASH_DIFFICULTY set to the default for production
  See https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1542 and https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/839

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario Outline: admin user deletes a user
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And the user "Alice" has created a new user with the following attributes:
      | userName    | <userName>    |
      | displayName | <displayName> |
      | email       | <email>       |
      | password    | <password>    |
    When the user "Alice" deletes a user "<userName>" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And user "<userName>" should not exist
    Examples:
      | userName             | displayName     | email               | password                     |
      | SameDisplayName      | Alice Hansen    | new@example.org     | containsCharacters(*:!;_+-&) |
      | withoutPassSameEmail | without pass    | alice@example.org   |                              |
      | name                 | pass with space | example@example.org | my pass                      |


  Scenario: delete a user and specify the user name in different case
    Given user "brand-new-user" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    When the user "Alice" deletes a user "Brand-New-User" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And user "brand-new-user" should not exist


  Scenario Outline: admin user deletes another user with different role
    Given user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And the administrator has assigned the role "<role>" to user "Brian" using the Graph API
    When the user "Alice" deletes a user "Brian" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And user "Brian" should not exist
    Examples:
      | role        |

  Scenario: admin user tries to delete his/her own account
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API

    And user "Alice" should exist


  Scenario Outline: non-admin user tries to delete his/her own account
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "<role>" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    When the user "Alice" deletes a user "Alice" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "401"
    And user "Alice" should exist
    Examples:
      | role        |
      | Space Admin |
      | User        |
      | User Light  |


  Scenario: admin user tries to delete a nonexistent user
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    When the user "Alice" tries to delete a nonexistent user using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "404"


  Scenario Outline: non-admin user tries to delete a nonexistent user
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "<role>" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    When the user "Alice" tries to delete a nonexistent user using the Graph API

    And the administrator has assigned the role "<userRole>" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    When the user "Alice" deletes a user "Brian" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "401"
    And user "Brian" should exist
