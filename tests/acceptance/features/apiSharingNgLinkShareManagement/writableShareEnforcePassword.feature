Feature: enforce password on writable shares
  As a user
  I want to enforce passwords on public links shared with upload, edit, or contribute permission
  So that the password is required to access the contents of the link


  Background:
    Given the following configs have been set:
      | config                                                 | value |
      | OCIS_SHARING_PUBLIC_SHARE_MUST_HAVE_PASSWORD           | false |
      | OCIS_SHARING_PUBLIC_WRITEABLE_SHARE_MUST_HAVE_PASSWORD | true  |
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And using spaces DAV path


  Scenario Outline: user should be able to create public link with permissions view and internal without a password
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "folder"
    When user "Alice" creates the following resource link share using the Graph API:
      | resource        | folder   |
      | space           | Personal |
      | permissionsRole | View     |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the JSON data of the response should match
