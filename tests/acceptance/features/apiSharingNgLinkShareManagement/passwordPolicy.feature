    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And using SharingNG


  Scenario: user should be allowed to create a public link with a password in accordance with the password policy
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "test file" to "folder/testfile.txt"
    When user "Alice" creates the following resource link share using the Graph API:
      | resource        | folder        |
      | space           | Personal      |
      | permissionsRole | Edit          |
      | password        | 3s:5WW9uE5h=A |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the public should not be able to download file "/testfile.txt" from inside the last public link shared folder using the public WebDAV API without a password
    And the public should not be able to download file "/testfile.txt" from inside the last public link shared folder using the public WebDAV API with password "wrong pass"
    But the public should be able to download file "/testfile.txt" from inside the last public link shared folder using the public WebDAV API with password "3s:5WW9uE5h=A"


  Scenario: user tries to create a public link with a password that does not comply with the password policy
