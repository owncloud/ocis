Feature: propagation of etags when copying files or folders
  As a client app
  I want metadata (etags) of parent folders to change when a file of folder is copied
  So that the client app can know to re-scan and sync the content of the folder(s)

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes

  @issue-4251
  Scenario Outline: copying a file does not change its etag
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content" to "file.txt"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/file.txt"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/file.txt" on path "/renamedFile.txt"
    When user "Alice" copies file "/file.txt" to "/renamedFile.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And these etags should not have changed:
      | user  | path      |
      | Alice | /file.txt |
    And these etags should have changed:
      | user  | path             |
      | Alice | /                |
      | Alice | /renamedFile.txt |
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |
