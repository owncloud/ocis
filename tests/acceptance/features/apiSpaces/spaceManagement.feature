Feature: Space management
  As a user with space admin permission
  I want to be able to manage all existing project spaces
  So that
  - I can get all project space where I am not member using "graph/v1.0/drives" endpoint
  - I can edit space: change quota, name, description
  - I can enable, disable, delete space

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |
    And using spaces DAV path
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Brian" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "Project" of type "project" with quota "10"


  Scenario: space admin user can see another project space even if he is not member of the space
    When user "Brian" lists all spaces via the Graph API with query "$filter=driveType eq 'project'"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the JSON response should contain space called "Project" and match
