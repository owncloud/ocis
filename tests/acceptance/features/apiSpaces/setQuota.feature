Feature: Set quota
  As a user
  I want to set quota to different users
  So that users can only take up a certain amount of storage space

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |


  Scenario Outline: admin sets personal space quota of user with different role
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And the administrator has assigned the role "<user-role>" to user "Brian" using the Graph API
    When user "Alice" changes the quota of the "Brian Murphy" space to "100" owned by user "Brian"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the JSON data of the response should match
