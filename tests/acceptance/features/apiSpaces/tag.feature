Feature: Tag
  As a user
  I want to tag resources
  So that I can sort and search them quickly

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And using spaces DAV path
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "use-tag" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a folder "folderMain" in space "use-tag"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "use-tag" with content "some content" to "folderMain/insideTheFolder.txt"


  Scenario: user creates tags for resources in the project space
    Given user "Alice" has sent the following space share invitation:
      | space           | use-tag      |
      | sharee          | Brian        |
      | shareType       | user         |
      | permissionsRole | Space Viewer |
    When user "Alice" creates the following tags for folder "folderMain" of space "use-tag":
      | tag level#1                    |
      | tag with symbols @^$#^%$@%!_+) |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    When user "Alice" sends PROPFIND request from the space "use-tag" to the resource "folderMain" with depth "0" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And as user "Alice" the PROPFIND response should contain a resource "folderMain" with these key and value pairs:
      | key     | value                                      |
      | oc:tags | tag level#1,tag with symbols @^$#^%$@%!_+) |
    When user "Alice" creates the following tags for file "folderMain/insideTheFolder.txt" of space "use-tag":
      | fileTag |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    When user "Brian" sends PROPFIND request from the space "use-tag" to the resource "folderMain/insideTheFolder.txt" with depth "0" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And as user "Alice" the PROPFIND response should contain a resource "insideTheFolder.txt" with these key and value pairs:
      | key     | value   |
      | oc:tags | fileTag |
    When user "Alice" lists all available tags via the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the response should contain following tags:
      | tag level#1                    |
      | tag with symbols @^$#^%$@%!_+) |
      | fileTag                        |
    When user "Alice" lists all available tags via the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the response should contain following tags:
      | tag level#1                    |
      | tag with symbols @^$#^%$@%!_+) |
      | fileTag                        |


  Scenario: user creates tags for resources in the personal space
    Given user "Alice" has created a folder "folderMain" in space "Alice Hansen"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "Personal" with content "some content" to "file.txt"
    When user "Alice" creates the following tags for folder "folderMain" of space "Alice Hansen":
      | my tag    |
      | important |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    When user "Alice" creates the following tags for file "file.txt" of space "Alice Hansen":
      | fileTag                       |
      | tag with symbol @^$#^%$@%!_+) |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    When user "Alice" sends PROPFIND request from the space "Alice Hansen" to the resource "folderMain" with depth "0" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And as user "Alice" the PROPFIND response should contain a resource "folderMain" with these key and value pairs:
      | key     | value            |
      | oc:tags | my tag,important |
    When user "Alice" sends PROPFIND request from the space "Alice Hansen" to the resource "file.txt" with depth "0" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And as user "Alice" the PROPFIND response should contain a resource "file.txt" with these key and value pairs:
