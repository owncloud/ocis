Feature: Change data of space
  As a user with space admin rights
  I want to be able to change the meta-data of a created space (increase the quota, change name, etc.)
  So that I can manage the spaces

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Bob      |
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "Project Jupiter" of type "project" with quota "20"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following space share invitation:
      | space           | Project Jupiter |
      | sharee          | Brian           |
      | shareType       | user            |
      | permissionsRole | Space Editor    |
    And user "Alice" has sent the following space share invitation:
      | space           | Project Jupiter |
      | sharee          | Bob             |
      | shareType       | user            |
      | permissionsRole | Space Viewer    |
    And using spaces DAV path


  Scenario: user with space manager role can change the name of a space via the Graph API
    When user "Alice" changes the name of the "Project Jupiter" space to "Project Death Star"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the JSON data of the response should match
      """

  Scenario Outline: user other than space manager role can't change the name of a Space via the Graph API

  Scenario Outline: user can't upload resource greater than set quota
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "<user-role>" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Admin" has changed the quota of space "Alice Hansen" to "15"
    When user "Alice" uploads a file inside space "Alice Hansen" with content "file is more than 15 bytes" to "file.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "507"
    And for user "Alice" the space "Personal" should not contain these entries:
      | file.txt |
    Examples:
      | user-role   |
      | Admin       |
      | Space Admin |
      | User        |
      | User Light  |


  Scenario Outline: admin user set own quota of a personal space via the Graph API and upload resource
    When user "Admin" changes the quota of the "Admin" space to "<quota-value>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    When user "Admin" uploads a file inside space "Admin" with content "file is more than 15 bytes" to "file.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be <http-status-code>
    And for user "Admin" the space "Personal" should contain these entries:
      | file.txt |
    Examples:
      | quota-value | http-status-code        |
      | 10000       | between "201" and "204" |
      | 0           | between "201" and "204" |
      | -1          | between "201" and "204" |


  Scenario Outline: admin user set an user personal space quota of via the Graph API and upload resource
    When user "Admin" changes the quota of the "Brian Murphy" space to "<quota-value>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    When user "Brian" uploads a file inside space "Brian Murphy" with content "file is more than 15 bytes" to "file.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be <http-status-code>
    And for user "Brian" the space "Personal" should contain these entries:
      | file.txt |
    Examples:
      | quota-value | http-status-code        |

      | -1          | between "201" and "204" |


  Scenario: user sends invalid space uuid via the graph API
    When user "Admin" tries to change the name of the "non-existing" space to "new name"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "404"
    When user "Admin" tries to change the quota of the "non-existing" space to "10"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "404"
    When user "Alice" tries to change the description of the "non-existing" space to "new description"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "404"


  Scenario: user sends PATCH request to other user's space that they don't have access to
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Carol    |
    When user "Carol" sends PATCH request to the space "Personal" of user "Alice" with data "{}"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "404"
    When user "Carol" sends PATCH request to the space "Project Jupiter" of user "Alice" with data "{}"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "404"

  Scenario Outline: space member with role 'Space Editor Without Versions' and Space Editor edits the space
    Given the administrator has enabled the permissions role "Space Editor Without Versions"
    And these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Carol    |
    And user "Alice" has sent the following space share invitation:

      | sharee          | Carol           |
      | shareType       | user            |

    When user "Carol" creates a folder ".space" in space "Project Jupiter" using the WebDav Api
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    When user "Carol" uploads a file inside space "Project Jupiter" with content "hello" to ".space/readme.md" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    When user "Carol" sets the file ".space/readme.md" as a description in a special section of the "Project Jupiter" space
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    When user "Carol" removes the folder ".space" from space "Project Jupiter"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
