Feature: Change data of space
  As a user with space admin rights
  I want to be able to change the meta-data of a created space (increase the quota, change name, etc.)
  So that I can manage the spaces

  Note - this feature is run in CI with ACCOUNTS_HASH_DIFFICULTY set to the default for production
  See https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1542 and https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/839

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Bob      |
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "Project Jupiter" of type "project" with quota "20"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following space share invitation:
      | space           | Project Jupiter |
      | sharee          | Brian           |
      | shareType       | user            |
      | permissionsRole | Space Editor    |
    And user "Alice" has sent the following space share invitation:
      | space           | Project Jupiter |
      | sharee          | Bob             |
      | shareType       | user            |
      | permissionsRole | Space Viewer    |
    And using spaces DAV path


  Scenario: user with space manager role can change the name of a space via the Graph API
    When user "Alice" changes the name of the "Project Jupiter" space to "Project Death Star"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the JSON data of the response should match
      """

  Scenario Outline: user other than space manager role can't change the name of a Space via the Graph API

    When user "Alice" uploads a file inside space "Alice Hansen" with content "file is more than 15 bytes" to "file.txt" using the WebDAV API
