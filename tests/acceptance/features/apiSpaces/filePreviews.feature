Feature: Preview file in project space
  As a user
  I want to be able to download different files for the preview
  So that I can preview the thumbnail of the file

  Note - this feature is run in CI with ACCOUNTS_HASH_DIFFICULTY set to the default for production
  See https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1542 and https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/839

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "previews of the files" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And using spaces DAV path


  Scenario Outline: user can preview created txt files in the project space
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "previews of the files" with content "test" to "<file-name>"
    When user "Alice" downloads the preview of "<file-name>" of the space "previews of the files" with width "<width>" and height "<height>" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    Examples:
      | file-name             | width | height |
      | /file.txt             | 36    | 36     |
      | /name with spaces.txt | 1200  | 1200   |


  Scenario Outline: user can preview image files in the project space
    Given using spaces DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file from "<source>" to "<destination>" via TUS inside of the space "previews of the files" using the WebDAV API
    When user "Alice" downloads the preview of "<destination>" of the space "previews of the files" with width "<width>" and height "<height>" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    Examples:
      | source                        | destination    | width | height |
      | filesForUpload/testavatar.png | testavatar.png | 36    | 36     |
      | filesForUpload/testavatar.png | testavatar.png | 1200  | 1200   |
      | filesForUpload/testavatar.png | testavatar.png | 1920  | 1920   |
      | filesForUpload/testavatar.jpg | testavatar.jpg | 36    | 36     |
      | filesForUpload/testavatar.jpg | testavatar.jpg | 1200  | 1200   |
      | filesForUpload/testavatar.jpg | testavatar.jpg | 1920  | 1920   |
      | filesForUpload/example.gif    | example.gif    | 36    | 36     |
      | filesForUpload/example.gif    | example.gif    | 1200  | 1200   |
      | filesForUpload/example.gif    | example.gif    | 1280  | 1280   |


  Scenario Outline: download preview of shared file inside project space
    Given user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file from "<source>" to "<destination>" via TUS inside of the space "previews of the files" using the WebDAV API
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | <destination>         |
      | space           | previews of the files |
      | sharee          | Brian                 |
      | shareType       | user                  |
      | permissionsRole | Viewer                |
    And user "Brian" has a share "<destination>" synced
    When user "Brian" downloads the preview of shared resource "/Shares/<destination>" with width "32" and height "32" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the downloaded image should be "32" pixels wide and "32" pixels high
    Examples:
      | source                        | destination    |
      | filesForUpload/testavatar.png | testavatar.png |
      | filesForUpload/lorem.txt      | lorem.txt      |

  @env-config
  Scenario Outline: download preview of shared file shared via Secure viewer permission role
    Given user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And the administrator has enabled the permissions role "Secure Viewer"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file from "<source>" to "<destination>" via TUS inside of the space "Alice Hansen" using the WebDAV API
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | <destination> |
      | space           | Personal      |
      | sharee          | Brian         |
      | shareType       | user          |
      | permissionsRole | Secure Viewer |
    And user "Brian" has a share "<destination>" synced
    When user "Brian" downloads the preview of shared resource "/Shares/<destination>" with width "32" and height "32" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    Examples:
      | source                        | destination    |
      | filesForUpload/testavatar.png | testavatar.png |
      | filesForUpload/lorem.txt      | lorem.txt      |


  Scenario: download preview of file inside shared folder in project space
    Given user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has created a folder "folder" in space "previews of the files"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "previews of the files" with content "test" to "/folder/lorem.txt"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        |  /folder              |
      | space           | previews of the files |
      | sharee          | Brian                 |
      | shareType       | user                  |
      | permissionsRole | Viewer                |
    And user "Brian" has a share "folder" synced
    When user "Brian" downloads the preview of shared resource "Shares/folder/lorem.txt" with width "32" and height "32" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the downloaded image should be "32" pixels wide and "32" pixels high
