Feature: upload file
  As a user
  I want to try uploading files to a nonexistent folder

  Scenario Outline: attempt to upload a file into a nonexistent shares
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" uploads file with content "uploaded content" to "/Shares/FOLDER/textfile.txt" using the TUS protocol on the WebDAV API
    Then as "Alice" folder "/Shares/FOLDER/" should not exist
    And as "Alice" file "/Shares/FOLDER/textfile.txt" should not exist

      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
