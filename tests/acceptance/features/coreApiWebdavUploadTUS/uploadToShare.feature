Feature: upload file to shared folder
  As a user
  I want to upload files on a shared folder
  So that other user with access on the shared folder can access the resource

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |


  Scenario Outline: uploading file to a received share folder
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | FOLDER   |
      | space           | Personal |
      | sharee          | Brian    |
      | shareType       | user     |
      | permissionsRole | Editor   |
    And user "Brian" has a share "FOLDER" synced
    When user "Brian" uploads file with content "uploaded content" to "/Shares/FOLDER/textfile.txt" using the TUS protocol on the WebDAV API
    Then as "Alice" file "/FOLDER/textfile.txt" should exist
    And the content of file "/FOLDER/textfile.txt" for user "Alice" should be "uploaded content"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |


  Scenario Outline: uploading file to a user read/write share folder works
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | FOLDER   |
      | space           | Personal |
      | sharee          | Brian    |
      | shareType       | user     |
      | permissionsRole | Uploader |
    And user "Brian" has a share "FOLDER" synced
    When user "Brian" uploads file with content "uploaded content" to "/Shares/FOLDER/textfile.txt" using the TUS protocol on the WebDAV API
    Then as "Alice" file "/FOLDER/textfile.txt" should exist
    And the content of file "/FOLDER/textfile.txt" for user "Alice" should be "uploaded content"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |

    And user "Alice" has created folder "/FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | FOLDER   |
      | space           | Personal |
      | sharee          | grp1     |
      | shareType       | group    |
      | permissionsRole | Uploader |
    And user "Brian" has a share "FOLDER" synced
    When user "Brian" uploads file with content "uploaded content" to "/Shares/FOLDER/textfile.txt" using the TUS protocol on the WebDAV API
    Then as "Alice" file "/FOLDER/textfile.txt" should exist
    And the content of file "/FOLDER/textfile.txt" for user "Alice" should be "uploaded content"

      | new              |


  Scenario Outline: overwrite file to a received share folder
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "original content" to "/FOLDER/textfile.txt"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | FOLDER   |
      | space           | Personal |
      | sharee          | Brian    |
      | shareType       | user     |
      | permissionsRole | Editor   |
    And user "Brian" has a share "FOLDER" synced
    When user "Brian" uploads file with content "overwritten content" to "/Shares/FOLDER/textfile.txt" using the TUS protocol on the WebDAV API
    Then as "Alice" file "/FOLDER/textfile.txt" should exist
    And the content of file "/FOLDER/textfile.txt" for user "Alice" should be "overwritten content"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |

    And user "Alice" has created a new TUS resource on the WebDAV API with these headers:
      | Upload-Length   | 16                        |
      #    dGV4dEZpbGUudHh0 is the base64 encode of textFile.txt
      | Upload-Metadata | filename dGV4dEZpbGUudHh0 |
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with checksum "SHA1 c1dab0c0864b6ac9bdd3743a1408d679f1acd823" to the last created TUS Location with offset "0" and content "original content" using the TUS protocol on the WebDAV API
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | textFile.txt |
      | space           | Personal     |
      | sharee          | Brian        |
      | shareType       | user         |
      | permissionsRole | File Editor  |
    And user "Brian" has a share "textFile.txt" synced
    When user "Brian" overwrites recently shared file with offset "0" and data "overwritten content" with checksum "SHA1 fe990d2686a0fc86004efc31f5bf2475a45d4906" using the TUS protocol on the WebDAV API with these headers:
      | Upload-Length   | 19                                    |
      #    dGV4dEZpbGUudHh0 is the base64 encode of /Shares/textFile.txt
      | Upload-Metadata | filename L1NoYXJlcy90ZXh0RmlsZS50eHQ= |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "460"
    And the content of file "/textFile.txt" for user "Alice" should be "original content"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
