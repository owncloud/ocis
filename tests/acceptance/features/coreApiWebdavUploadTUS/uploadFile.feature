  Scenario Outline: upload a file and check download content
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" uploads file with content "uploaded content" to "<file-name>" using the TUS protocol on the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And the content of file "<file-name>" for user "Alice" should be "uploaded content"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version | file-name         |
      | old              | /upload.txt       |
