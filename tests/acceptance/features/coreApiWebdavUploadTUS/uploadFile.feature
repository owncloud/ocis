Feature: upload file
  As a user
  I want to be able to upload files
  So that I can store and share files between multiple client systems

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario Outline: upload a file and check download content
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" uploads file with content "uploaded content" to "<file-name>" using the TUS protocol on the WebDAV API
    Then the content of file "<file-name>" for user "Alice" should be "uploaded content"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version | file-name         |
      | old              | /upload.txt       |
      | old              | /नेपाली.txt       |
      | old              | /strängé file.txt |
      | old              | /s,a,m,p,l,e.txt  |
      | old              | /C++ file.cpp     |
      | old              | /?fi=le&%#2 . txt |
      | old              | /# %ab ab?=ed     |
      | new              | /upload.txt       |
      | new              | /strängé file.txt |
      | new              | /नेपाली.txt       |
      | new              | /s,a,m,p,l,e.txt  |
      | new              | /C++ file.cpp     |
      | new              | /?fi=le&%#2 . txt |
      | new              | /# %ab ab?=ed     |
      | spaces           | /upload.txt       |
      | spaces           | /strängé file.txt |
      | spaces           | /नेपाली.txt       |
      | spaces           | /s,a,m,p,l,e.txt  |
      | spaces           | /C++ file.cpp     |
      | spaces           | /?fi=le&%#2 . txt |

  Scenario Outline: upload a file into a folder and check download content
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "<folder-name>"
    When user "Alice" uploads file with content "uploaded content" to "<folder-name>/<file-name>" using the TUS protocol on the WebDAV API
    Then the content of file "<folder-name>/<file-name>" for user "Alice" should be "uploaded content"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version | folder-name                      | file-name                     |

      | Upload-Metadata | filename <metadata> |
      | Tus-Resumable   | 1.0.0               |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "412"

      | header   |
      | Location |
