Feature: upload file
  As a user
  I want the mtime of an uploaded file to be the creation date on upload source not the upload date
  So that I can find files by their real creation date

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes

  Scenario Outline: upload file with mtime
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "file.txt" with mtime "Thu, 08 Aug 2019 04:18:13 GMT" using the TUS protocol on the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And as "Alice" the mtime of the file "file.txt" should be "Thu, 08 Aug 2019 04:18:13 GMT"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |
