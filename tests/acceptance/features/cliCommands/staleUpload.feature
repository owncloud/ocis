Feature: stale upload via CLI command
  As a user
  I want to manage stale uploads
  So that I clean up stale uploads from storage

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes


  Scenario: list and delete all stale uploads
    Given the config "POSTPROCESSING_DELAY" has been set to "10s"
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "staleuploads" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file "filesForUpload/testavatar.jpg" to "/testavatar.jpg" in space "staleuploads"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "textfile.txt"
    And the administrator has stopped the server
    And the administrator has created stale upload
    And the administrator has started the server
    When the administrator lists all the stale uploads
    Then the command should be successful
    And the CLI response should contain the following message:
      """
      Scanning all spaces for stale processing nodes...
      Total stale nodes: 2
      """
    When the administrator deletes all the stale uploads
    Then the command should be successful
    And the CLI response should contain the following message:
      """
      Scanning all spaces for stale processing nodes...
      Total stale nodes: 2
      """
    And there should be "0" stale uploads
