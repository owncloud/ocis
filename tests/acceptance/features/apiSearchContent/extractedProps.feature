Feature: propfind extracted props
  As a user
  I want to get extracted properties of resource
  So that I can make sure that the response contains audio, location, image and photo properties

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And using spaces DAV path


  Scenario: check extracted properties of a file from project space
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "new-space" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file "filesForUpload/testaudio.mp3" to "testaudio.mp3" in space "new-space"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file "filesForUpload/testavatar.jpg" to "testavatar.jpg" in space "new-space"
    When user "Alice" gets the following extracted properties of resource "testaudio.mp3" inside space "new-space" using the WebDAV API
      | propertyName |
      | oc:audio     |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And as user "Alice" the PROPFIND response should contain a space "new-space" with these key and value pairs:
