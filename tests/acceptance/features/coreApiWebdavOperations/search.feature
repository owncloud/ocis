Feature: Search
  As a user
  I would like to be able to search for files
  So that I can find needed files quickly

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/just-a-folder"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/फनी näme"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/upload folder"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/upload😀 😁"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/upload.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/a-image.png"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/just-a-folder/upload.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/just-a-folder/lolol.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/just-a-folder/a-image.png"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/just-a-folder/uploadÜठिF.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/फनी näme/upload.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/फनी näme/a-image.png"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/upload😀 😁/upload😀 😁.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "file with comma in filename" to "/upload😀 😁/upload,1.txt"

  Scenario Outline: search for entry by pattern
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" searches for "*upload*" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the search result of user "Alice" should contain these entries:
      | /upload.txt                   |
      | /just-a-folder/upload.txt     |
      | /upload folder                |

  Scenario Outline: search for entries by only some letters from the middle of the entry name
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "FOLDER"
    When user "Alice" searches for "*ol*" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the search result should contain "4" entries
    And the search result of user "Alice" should contain these entries:
