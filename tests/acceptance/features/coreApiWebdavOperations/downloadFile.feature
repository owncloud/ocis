Feature: download file
  As a user
  I want to be able to download files
  So that I can work wih local copies of files on my client system

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 0" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "Welcome this is just an example file for developers." to "/welcome.txt"

  Scenario Outline: download a zero byte size file
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/zerobyte.txt" to "/zerobyte.txt"
    When user "Alice" downloads file "/zerobyte.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the size of the downloaded file should be 0 bytes
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |


  Scenario Outline: try to download recently deleted file
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" deletes file "textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    When user "Alice" tries to download file "textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "404"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |
