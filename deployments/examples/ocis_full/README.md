  Providing two variants using detailed configuration step by step guides:\
  [Local Production Setup](https://doc.owncloud.com/ocis/next/depl-examples/ubuntu-compose/ubuntu-compose-prod.html) and [Deploy Infinite Scale on the Hetzner Cloud](https://doc.owncloud.com/ocis/next/depl-examples/ubuntu-compose/ubuntu-compose-hetzner.html).\
  Note that these examples use LetsEncrypt certificates and are intended for production use.

## Optional Services

### Keycloak

Keycloak can be optionally enabled by uncommenting the corresponding variables in the `.env` file:
- `KEYCLOAK=:keycloak.yml`

Note that Keycloak requires the default `ocis` Identity Provider to be disabled, which is automatically handled when the `keycloak.yml` configuration is used.
