/*
Package admin is a convenience layer to support the administration of
CephFS volumes, subvolumes, etc.

Unlike the cephfs package this API does not map to APIs provided by
ceph libraries themselves. This API is not yet stable and is subject
to change.

This package only supports ceph "nautilus" and "octopus" at this time.
