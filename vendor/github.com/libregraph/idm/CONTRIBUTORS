# This is the official list of people who can contribute
# (and typically have contributed) code to the LibreGraph repository.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people.  For example, Kopano employees are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because Kopano holds the copyright.
#
# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Individual's name <submission email address>
#     Individual's name <submission email address> <email2> <emailN>
#
# An entry with multiple email addresses specifies that the
# first address should be used in the submit logs.

# Please keep the list sorted.
