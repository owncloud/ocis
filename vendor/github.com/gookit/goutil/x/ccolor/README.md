# CColor

`CColor` is a simple command-line color output library that uses ANSI color codes to output text with colors.
Its main code is a partial code extracted and simplified from `gookit/color`, which only supports simple 16-color ANSI color output.

> Tip: If you want to render with richer colors, use the [github.com/gookit/color](https://github.com/gookit/color) package.

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/gookit/goutil/x/ccolor
```
