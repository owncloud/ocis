# CONTRIBUTING

This open source project welcomes everybody that wants to contribute to it by implementing new features, fixing bugs, testing, creating documentation or simply talk about it. 

Most contributions will start by creating a new Issue to discuss what is the contribution about and to agree on the steps to move forward. 

## Issues

All issues reports are welcome. Open a new Issue whenever you want to report a bug, request a change or make a proposal.

This should be your start point of contribution. 


## Pull Requests

If you have any changes that can be merged, feel free to send a Pull Request. 

Usually, you'd want to create a new Issue to discuss about the change you want to merge and why it's needed or what it solves.
