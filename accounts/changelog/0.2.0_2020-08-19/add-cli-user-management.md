Enhancement: Add early version of cli tools for user-management

Following commands are available:

list, ls        List existing accounts
add, create,    Create a new account
update          Make changes to an existing account
remove, rm      Removes an existing account
inspect         Show detailed data on an existing account

See --help for details.

Note that not all account-attributes have an effect yet. This is due to ocis
being in an early development stage.
