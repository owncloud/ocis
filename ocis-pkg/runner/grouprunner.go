// GroupRunner represent a group of tasks that need to run together.
// The expectation is that all the tasks will run at the same time, and when
// one of them stops, the rest will also stop.
//
// The GroupRunner is intended to be used to run multiple services, which are
// more or less independent from eachother, but at the same time it doesn't
// make sense to have any of them stopped while the rest are running.
// Basically, either all of them run, or none of them.
// For example, you can have a GRPC and HTTP servers running, each of them
// providing a piece of functionality, however, if any of them fails, the
// feature provided by them would be incomplete or broken.
//
// The interrupt duration for the group can be set through the
// `WithInterruptDuration` option. If the option isn't supplied, the default
// value `DefaultGroupInterruptDuration` will be used.
//
// It's recommended that the timeouts are handled by each runner individually,
// meaning that each runner's timeout should be less than the group runner's
// timeout. This way, we can know which runner timed out.
// If the group timeout is reached, the remaining results will have the
// runner's id as "_unknown_".
//
// Note that, as services, the task aren't expected to stop by default.
// This means that, if a task finishes naturally, the rest of the task will
// asked to stop as well.
